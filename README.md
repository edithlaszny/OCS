# OCS
OCS meaning Ontology for Computational Sociology. The OCS distribution package contains all source files, configuration text files, and shell scripts: thus, users of the system have the ability to make all possible changes, also OCS is not merely a theoretical concept, a realised ontology, but a fully functional Java application.

Quick Start:
Didn't want to bloat the repo with a monolithic codebase, so I've packaged this as modular imports. Spin up a Java project in your IDE of choice (I'm running Eclipse 2025-03 (4.35.0) with the LaTeX plugin, but you do you). Import the 9 .zip files and you're good to go. The code's pretty clean—nothing you haven't debugged before.

What You Need
Database: Grab the data.zip (that's #10)—your IDE outputs land here. You'll need MySQL 8.0.30+ or equivalent. No MySQL-specific dialect used, so swap engines if needed.
Terminal junkies: JARs and shell scripts included if you want to skip the IDE and run everything from the command line.

Documentation:
Check OCS.pdf for the full breakdown of what this thing actually does.
