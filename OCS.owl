        <IRI>#Absolute_Poverty</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Absolute poverty, also known as subsistence poverty, defines a condition where individuals or families lack the minimal resources to meet their basic needs for survival, including food, shelter, warmth, and safety. This standard is based on a minimum level of subsistence below which families should not be expected to exist. It signifies a severe deprivation of essential necessities required for human well-being. The measurement of absolute poverty often involves a fixed income threshold that remains constant over time, although the specific level can vary between countries based on their economic conditions. The World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than US $1.25 or $1.90 a day. While useful for tracking income changes over time, this measure may not fully capture the realities of living in poverty, such as the inability to buy in bulk or social and cultural needs.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Achieved_Status</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Achieved status refers to a social position that a person attains largely through their own efforts, skills, abilities, and choices. It is earned or chosen based on merit and reflects personal accomplishments. Examples include becoming an Olympic medalist, a college graduate, a technical professional, or even a criminal. This is in contrast to ascribed status, which is assigned at birth or is beyond an individual's control, such as race or sex. Achieved status comes with associated rights, obligations, behaviours, and duties expected of those in that position, known as roles. While ideally based on merit, the ability to achieve certain statuses can be influenced by ascribed statuses and cultural capital. Achieved status plays a significant role in open societies where social mobility, the ability to move up or down the social hierarchy, is possible.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Adoption</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Adoption is a legal process that allows for the permanent transfer of the legal rights, responsibilities, and privileges of parenthood to a new legal parent or parents from the biological or legal parents. Unlike guardianship, adoption is intended to create a permanent change in status, requiring societal recognition through legal or religious sanction. Historically, adoption practices often emphasised the adopter's political and economic interests, such as ensuring male heirs. However, modern adoption laws prioritise the child's welfare and development. Different types of adoption include foster care adoption, international adoption, and embryo adoption. Adoption is a complex process with emotional implications for adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents, often involving questions of identity and belonging. The evolution of adoption reflects changing societal values towards prioritizing the best interests of the child.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Affirmative_Action</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Affirmative action refers to actions favouring those who tend to suffer from discrimination, representing positive efforts to recruit minority group members or women for jobs, promotions, and educational opportunities. It aims to increase the representation of groups historically excluded from areas like employment and education. Unlike equal opportunity, which is passive, affirmative action is proactive, involving measures to avert discrimination. Policies may include preferential selection and monitoring workforce composition. Originating in the 1960s, affirmative action seeks to remedy past and present discrimination and promote diversity. However, it has faced debate, with opponents arguing it constitutes reverse discrimination, while proponents emphasise its necessity for addressing ongoing inequalities and fostering inclusion. The legal landscape surrounding affirmative action is complex and has evolved over time.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Ageing</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Ageing, or aging, is the combination of biological, psychological, and social processes that affect people as they grow older. Biologically, it involves physical maturation and changes in the body over time. Psychologically, it can involve shifts in cognitive function and emotional development. Sociologically, ageing entails changes in social roles, relationships, and societal expectations at different life stages. The experience of ageing is also shaped by cultural factors, with different societies having varying views on what it means to be a certain age. The human life course is often divided into stages like infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age, though these are somewhat arbitrary. Social gerontology is a field that specifically studies the social aspects of ageing.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Ageism is discrimination or prejudice against a person on the grounds of age. While older people are the most common targets, younger individuals can also experience it. Ageism can manifest as institutional ageism through discriminatory policies, interpersonal ageism in social interactions, and internalised ageism where individuals adopt ageist beliefs about themselves. It is often rooted in negative stereotypes, such as the belief that older people are frail or incapable. Ageism is considered by some to be the last socially acceptable prejudice. It can negatively impact mental and physical health and may even be associated with earlier death. Efforts to combat ageism include policy changes, education, and intergenerational programs.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Agencies of socialisation are groups or social contexts within which processes of socialisation take place. Socialisation is the lifelong process through which individuals learn the norms, values, beliefs, and behaviours of their society.[25, 26] The family is typically considered the primary agent of socialisation, having the most influence during early childhood, teaching basic social norms, values, language, and behaviour. Secondary agents of socialisation become more influential as individuals mature and include peer groups, schools, the media, religion, government, and the workplace. These agents contribute to learning societal expectations, academic knowledge, social skills, and professional roles. The community and neighborhood also play a role by providing opportunities for social interaction and learning local norms.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Aging_Studies</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Aging Studies is an interdisciplinary field dedicated to the comprehensive examination of the multifaceted process of human aging. This academic domain draws insights from sociology, psychology, biology, public health, economics, and policy studies to understand the physiological, cognitive, emotional, and social changes that occur throughout the life course, particularly in later life. It focuses on the experiences of older adults, the social roles they occupy, the challenges they face (such as ageism, health issues, and retirement), and the societal responses to an increasingly aging population. Researchers in Aging Studies investigate topics like social support networks, elder care systems, generational differences, healthy aging initiatives, and the impact of demographic shifts on social institutions. The field also addresses the social construction of old age and the cultural perceptions of longevity, aiming to promote well-being and equitable policies for all age groups within society. It is crucial for informing public policy and promoting a nuanced understanding of later life.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">An agrarian society is the most technologically advanced form of preindustrial society, where members are primarily engaged in the production of food but increase their crop yield through innovations such as the plow. It is any community whose economy is fundamentally based on the production and maintenance of crops and farmland, with agriculture serving as the primary source of wealth. Agrarian societies emerged after hunter-gatherer and horticultural societies, marking a transition to settled agricultural communities around 10,000 years ago. Key characteristics include a predominantly rural population, social hierarchies often based on land ownership, the use of agricultural technologies, and cultural practices tied to agricultural cycles. The surplus of food enabled population growth and the development of more complex social structures, including specialised occupations and trade.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Alienation</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Alienation is the condition of being estranged or disassociated from the surrounding society. It involves a feeling of separation from one's milieu, work, the products of work, or self. The sense that our own abilities, as human beings, are taken over by other entities is also a key aspect. Sociologists like Marx described alienation in capitalist labor, where workers feel disconnected from their labor and its products. Durkheim focused on anomie, a state of normlessness leading to social alienation. Common variations of alienation include powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, cultural estrangement, social isolation, and self-estrangement. Alienation is a recurring theme in sociological analysis of modern life and is often depicted in literature and popular culture as psychological isolation.</Literal>

These aggregates reflect changing social norms, economic pressures, and cultural values that have expanded definitions of what constitutes a family beyond traditional biological and legal ties. They demonstrate how individuals create meaningful kinship networks and family-like relationships based on emotional bonds, mutual support, and shared commitment rather than solely on biological connection or legal recognition. These family forms often emerge in response to social marginalisation, economic necessity, or personal choice, highlighting the resilience and creativity of human social organisation in meeting fundamental needs for belonging, support, and care.</Literal>

This class encompasses subcultures that deliberately oppose mainstream values (Counterculture, Deviant_Subculture), alternative relationship arrangements that exist outside traditional marriage (Cohabitation), and dynamic cultural expressions that reflect temporary collective preferences (Fashion). It also includes informal behavioural norms that guide everyday social interaction (Folkways) and theoretical concepts that explain unintended social consequences (Latent_Functions). These phenomena demonstrate the diversity and adaptability of human social organisation, showing how societies accommodate difference, manage deviance, and generate new forms of cultural expression. This grouping highlights the dynamic tension between conformity and innovation that characterises all social systems.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Amalgamation</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Amalgamation is the process by which a majority group and a minority group combine through intermarriage to form a new group. This process, also known as miscegenation, involves biological and cultural merging, often leading to a new, unified group identity. The concept of a "melting pot" is often used to describe amalgamation, where different cultures blend to create an entirely new culture, unlike assimilation where one group adopts the dominant culture, or pluralism where groups coexist while retaining their distinct identities. Cultural amalgamation involves a mutual appreciation and integration of social norms, traditions, and both material and nonmaterial aspects of each contributing culture. Historically, laws against miscegenation existed, highlighting societal resistance to this process.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Animism</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Animism is the belief that events in the world are mobilised by the activities of spirits, suggesting that inanimate objects, natural phenomena, and even abstract concepts possess a soul or spiritual essence. This belief system often involves the idea that spirits inhabit the natural world and influence human affairs. In animistic worldviews, spirits are not necessarily seen as supernatural beings separate from the material world but rather as integral parts of it. These spirits can be benevolent, malevolent, or neutral, and they may require appeasement or interaction through rituals and offerings. Animism is a broad category encompassing diverse beliefs and practices found in many indigenous cultures around the world. It often forms the basis of traditional religions and can influence various aspects of life, including social customs, moral codes, and explanations of natural events. The concept of animism was notably explored by early anthropologists like Sir Edward Tylor, who considered it to be the earliest form of religious belief.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Anomie</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Anomie is a sociological concept, primarily associated with Emile Durkheim, that describes a state of normlessness or social disorganisation within a society or a social group. It occurs when there is a breakdown or absence of clear moral guidelines, social norms, and shared values, leading to a sense of confusion, disorientation, and lack of social regulation among individuals. Durkheim argued that rapid social change, such as industrialisation or economic crises, can disrupt traditional social bonds and norms, thereby contributing to anomie. When individuals experience anomie, they may feel disconnected from society, lack a sense of purpose, and be unsure of what behaviours are expected or appropriate. This state can lead to various negative consequences, including increased rates of deviance, crime, despair, and suicide, as individuals struggle to find meaning and direction in a deregulated social environment. Robert Merton later expanded on the concept, applying it to the strain individuals feel when culturally prescribed goals are not attainable through legitimate means.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Anomie_Theory_Of_Deviance</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">The anomie theory of deviance, developed by Robert Merton, explains deviance as an adaptation either of socially prescribed goals or of the norms governing their attainment, or both. This theory posits that societal norms and values can create strain or anomie when individuals are unable to achieve culturally valued goals through legitimate means. Merton identified five modes of adaptation to this strain: conformity, innovation, ritualism, retreatism, and rebellion. Conformity involves accepting both the goals and the means to achieve them. Innovation involves accepting the goals but rejecting the legitimate means, often resorting to deviant behaviour to achieve success. Ritualism occurs when individuals abandon the pursuit of societal goals but rigidly adhere to the established norms. Retreatism involves rejecting both the goals and the means, often leading to social withdrawal. Rebellion involves rejecting the existing goals and means and attempting to replace them with new ones. Merton's theory highlights how social structures can unintentionally lead to deviance by creating a disconnect between cultural goals and the available means to achieve them.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Anti-Semitism</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Antisemitism or Jew-hatred is hostility to, prejudice towards, or discrimination against Jews. A person who harbours it is called an antisemite. Whether antisemitism is considered a form of racism depends on the school of thought. Antisemitic tendencies may be motivated primarily by negative sentiment towards Jews as a people or negative sentiment towards Jews with regard to Judaism. In the former case, usually known as racial antisemitism, a person's hostility is driven by the belief that Jews constitute a distinct race with inherent traits or characteristics that are repulsive or inferior to the preferred traits or characteristics within that person's society. In the latter case, known as religious antisemitism, a person's hostility is driven by their religion's perception of Jews and Judaism, typically encompassing doctrines of supersession that expect or demand Jews to turn away from Judaism and submit to the religion presenting itself as Judaism's successor faithâ€”this is a common theme within the other Abrahamic religions.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Anticipatory_Socialisation</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Anticipatory socialisation refers to the processes of socialisation in which a person "rehearses" for future positions, occupations, and social relationships. This involves learning the norms, values, and behaviours associated with a status or role that the individual expects to occupy in the future. By engaging in anticipatory socialisation, individuals can prepare themselves for the challenges and expectations of new roles, making the transition smoother when they eventually occupy those positions. Examples include teenagers who start dressing or behaving in ways they associate with adulthood, or students who take on internships to learn about a future profession. This process can help individuals develop the necessary skills and understanding to navigate new social environments and fulfill the requirements of future roles effectively. It plays a crucial role in facilitating social mobility and adaptation to changing life circumstances.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Apartheid</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Apartheid was the former policy of the South African government designed to maintain the separation of Blacks and other non-Whites from the dominant Whites. This system of racial segregation and discrimination was implemented through legislation that classified people into racial groups and enforced their separation in all aspects of life, including housing, education, employment, healthcare, and political participation. The apartheid regime systematically privileged the White minority and subjected the Black majority to severe oppression and denial of basic human rights. This policy was in effect from 1948 to 1994 and drew widespread international condemnation, leading to various sanctions and boycotts against South Africa. The dismantling of apartheid began in the early 1990s with the release of Nelson Mandela and the subsequent reforms that led to multiracial elections and the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa. The legacy of apartheid continues to impact South African society, with ongoing efforts to address the deep-seated inequalities and social divisions created by this discriminatory system.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Applied_And_Institutional_Studies encompasses sociological domains that examine major social institutions and organised collective activities that structure contemporary social life. These fields analyse how formal and informal institutions shape social behaviour, distribute resources and power, and respond to social challenges and changes. The domain emphasises the intersection between institutional structures and social action, examining how organisations, movements, and institutional arrangements both constrain and enable human agency. These studies contribute to understanding how societies organise themselves around fundamental challenges such as governance, health, communication, environmental sustainability, and social change. They bridge academic sociology with practical applications, often informing policy development and institutional reform. The domain recognises that modern societies are characterised by complex institutional arrangements that require specialised analytical attention. These fields collectively examine how institutions mediate between individual experience and broader social structures, analysing the dynamics of institutional change, the relationship between formal and informal institutional arrangements, and the ways institutions both reproduce and transform social relationships and power structures in contemporary societies.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Applied social research is research which aims not just to understand a social problem, but also to make a contribution to solving it. Unlike basic research, which focuses on expanding fundamental knowledge, applied research is directed towards addressing specific real-world issues and informing practical solutions. Much criminological research, for example, is applied research, aiming to reduce levels of crime through the study of its causes and effective interventions. Applied social research is a feature of all social science disciplines and often demands the involvement of multi-disciplinary teams to tackle complex social problems effectively. This type of research can involve evaluating the effectiveness of social programs, developing new interventions, or informing policy decisions to improve social outcomes.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Argot refers to the specialised language used by members of a group or subculture. This jargon or slang serves to distinguish members of the group from outsiders and can reinforce group identity and cohesion. Argot often includes unique vocabulary, expressions, and meanings that are understood by those within the group but may be incomprehensible to others. It can develop in various social contexts, such as among occupational groups, criminal subcultures, hobbyist communities, or even within specific age groups. The use of argot can facilitate communication among group members, create a sense of exclusivity, and signal belonging. It can also evolve over time as the group's activities, interests, and social dynamics change. Studying argot can provide insights into the values, norms, and social structure of a particular group or subculture.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Ascribed status is a social position "assigned" to a person by society without regard for the person's unique talents or characteristics. It is a status that is beyond an individual's control, often based on factors such as race, ethnicity, sex, age, family background, or birth order. Unlike achieved status, which is earned through personal effort, ascribed status is something an individual is born with or involuntarily acquires. While ascribed statuses may not directly reflect an individual's abilities or efforts, they can significantly influence their opportunities and social interactions within a society. For example, in many societies, gender and race are ascribed statuses that can lead to differential treatment and expectations. The relative importance of ascribed versus achieved status varies across societies and over time, with modern societies often emphasizing achieved status as a basis for social standing, although ascribed statuses continue to play a significant role in social stratification.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Authority is power that has been institutionalised and is recognised by the people over whom it is exercised. It is a form of legitimate power, meaning that those subject to it accept its rightfulness. Sociologist Max Weber identified three main types of authority: traditional authority, charismatic authority, and rational-legal authority. Traditional authority is based on long-established customs and traditions, often associated with hereditary leadership. Charismatic authority stems from the exceptional personal qualities or appeal of a leader, inspiring devotion and obedience. Rational-legal authority is based on formal rules, laws, and procedures, typically associated with bureaucratic systems and elected officials. The recognition and acceptance of authority are crucial for maintaining social order and stability within a society. When power is perceived as legitimate authority, it is more likely to be obeyed and less likely to be challenged.</Literal>

It is where individuals can relax their public image, step out of their roles, and behave more spontaneously. The back region is characterised by informality, where performers can prepare for their front stage performances, discuss them with fellow performers, and contradict the impression they present to the audience. This space allows for behaviours that might be considered inappropriate or inconsistent with the front stage persona.

This means that an individual traces their ancestry and kinship ties through both their mother's and father's sides of the family. In societies with bilateral descent, there is no strong emphasis on either the paternal or maternal line; both are considered equally significant. This system is common in many modern Western societies. It contrasts with unilineal descent systems, such as patrilineal descent (where kinship is traced through the father's line) and matrilineal descent (where kinship is traced through the mother's line), where one side of the family is considered more important than the other. Bilateral descent often leads to a wider network of recognised relatives compared to unilineal systems.</Literal>

This movement emerged during the Civil Rights era, advocating for self-determination, racial pride, and the development of Black political and economic power to achieve equality and liberation. It represented a shift from earlier strategies of nonviolent integration to a more assertive stance emphasizing Black autonomy and the need to address systemic racism and oppression. The Black Power movement encompassed a range of ideologies and goals, including Black nationalism, Black separatism, and Black self-reliance.

This authority rests on the extraordinary qualities or perceived heroism of an individual, which inspire devotion, trust, and obedience in their followers. Unlike traditional authority, which is based on established customs, or rational-legal authority, which is based on rules and laws, charismatic authority is highly personal and often emerges during times of social upheaval or crisis. Leaders with charismatic authority may possess exceptional speaking abilities, a compelling vision, or a perceived connection to a higher power. However, charismatic authority can be unstable and often depends on the continued belief and support of the followers in the leader's unique qualities. It typically needs to be routinised into either traditional or rational-legal authority to ensure its long-term stability and continuity after the charismatic leader is gone.</Literal>

While Marx focused primarily on the ownership of the means of production as the basis of class, Weber provided a more multidimensional view, distinguishing between class (economic position), status (social prestige or honor), and power (political influence). According to Weber, these three dimensions of social stratification can intersect and influence an individual's overall position in society.

The first stage, the sensorimotor stage (birth to about 2 years), involves learning through senses and motor actions. The preoperational stage (about 2 to 7 years) is marked by the development of symbolic thought and language but also by egocentrism and a lack of logical reasoning. The concrete operational stage (about 7 to 11 years) sees the development of logical thinking about concrete events and objects, including the understanding of conservation. Finally, the formal operational stage (from about 12 years and into adulthood) involves the ability to think abstractly and hypothetically. Piaget's theory emphasises that cognitive development is a continuous process of adaptation through assimilation (incorporating new information into existing schemas) and accommodation (modifying existing schemas to fit new information).</Literal>

Examples of collective behaviour include panics, fads, rumors, social movements, and disasters.

Developed by Ernest Burgess in the 1920s, this model suggests that cities expand outward from a central point in a pattern of concentric zones, each with distinct social and economic characteristics. The innermost zone is typically the central business district, followed by a zone of transition characterised by mixed residential and commercial uses and often experiencing social problems.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">The conflict perspective is a major sociological approach that assumes that social behaviour is best understood in terms of conflict or tension between competing groups over scarce resources. Unlike the functionalist perspective, which emphasises social harmony and stability, the conflict perspective highlights power struggles, inequality, and social change as inherent features of society. Key theorists associated with the conflict perspective include Karl Marx, who focused on class conflict, and Max Weber, who considered conflict arising from differences in class, status, and power. Contemporary conflict theorists examine various sources of social conflict, including those based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, and other forms of social inequality. This perspective views social institutions and social order as often reflecting the interests of the dominant groups in society.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Conflict theories represent a sociological perspective that focuses on the inherent tensions, divisions, and competing interests present in human societies. Unlike functionalist perspectives that emphasise social harmony, conflict theorists believe that the scarcity and value of resources in society inevitably produce conflict as different groups struggle to gain access to and control those resources. These resources can include wealth, power, status, and opportunities. Many conflict theorists have been strongly influenced by the writings of Karl Marx, who emphasised class conflict as the primary driver of social change. However, contemporary conflict theories also examine other sources of conflict, such as those based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, and sexual orientation. This perspective views social order as often maintained by the dominance of certain groups over others, with dominant groups using their power to protect their interests and maintain the existing social hierarchy. Social change, from this viewpoint, often occurs through the struggles and conflicts between these competing groups as they challenge existing power structures.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">A consumer society is a type of society that promotes the consumption of mass-produced products as a central aspect of social life and individual identity. These societies are characterised by a high level of material consumption and a culture that values the acquisition of goods and services. Consumer societies also generate an ideology of consumerism, which assumes that ever-increasing mass consumption is beneficial for both individuals and the economy. This ideology often links personal happiness and success to the accumulation of material possessions. Consumer culture is heavily influenced by advertising and marketing, which constantly create new desires and needs. While consumer societies can lead to economic growth and innovation, they have also been criticised for their potential negative impacts on the environment, social inequality, and individual well-being due to the emphasis on materialism over other values.</Literal>

This theory suggests that increased interaction under the right conditions can lead to greater understanding, empathy, and a reduction in negative stereotypes and biases between groups. For contact to be effective in reducing prejudice, several conditions are typically considered important: equal status of the groups in the contact situation, common goals that require intergroup cooperation, intergroup cooperation and interdependence, and the support of authorities or social norms for intergroup contact. When these conditions are met, intergroup contact can challenge existing stereotypes, increase awareness of similarities between groups, and foster positive attitudes, ultimately leading to a decrease in prejudice.</Literal>

This research method is used to analyse the content of various forms of communication, such as texts, images, audio, and video. The process involves developing a coding scheme to categorise the content based on specific variables or themes of interest to the researcher. The data is then systematically analysed to quantify the frequency and relationships between these categories. Content analysis can be used to study a wide range of topics, including media representations, political discourse, cultural trends, and social interactions. Its strength lies in its ability to provide a quantitative and objective analysis of qualitative data, allowing researchers to draw conclusions based on empirical evidence.</Literal>

This theory, notably developed by Travis Hirschi, posits that individuals are less likely to engage in deviant behaviour when they have strong social bonds. Hirschi identified four elements of social bonds: attachment (strong relationships with others), commitment (investment in conventional activities), involvement (participation in legitimate activities), and belief (acceptance of societal norms and values). According to control theory, these bonds create a stake in conformity, making individuals more likely to adhere to social norms and less likely to engage in deviance because they fear losing these connections and investments. Weak or broken social bonds, on the other hand, can increase the likelihood of deviance.</Literal>

By keeping the control variable the same across different conditions or groups in a study, researchers can better isolate the effect of the independent variable they are interested in. This helps to rule out the possibility that changes in the dependent variable are due to the control variable rather than the independent variable. Using control variables is a key aspect of experimental and quantitative research designs aimed at establishing causal relationships between variables. For example, in a study examining the effect of a new teaching method (independent variable) on student test scores (dependent variable), researchers might control for students' prior academic performance (control variable) to ensure that any observed changes in test scores are indeed due to the new teaching method and not pre-existing differences in academic ability.</Literal>

The overarching process of socialisation provides the general framework for cultural transmission, while primary and secondary socialisation represent distinct phases with different agents, contexts, and developmental outcomes. Political socialisation represents a specialised domain focusing on civic and political learning. Education serves as both a formal agent of socialisation and a structured process for knowledge transmission.

They argue that market mechanisms, driven by rising prices of scarce resources, will incentivise innovation and substitution, ensuring continuous progress and an ever-increasing capacity for the Earth to support a growing population.

A coefficient of -1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases proportionally. A coefficient of 0 indicates no linear correlation between the two variables.

It is a fundamental measure in demography, providing a snapshot of the reproductive activity within a population during a specific time period, typically a year. This rate is calculated by taking the total number of live births in a year, dividing it by the total population (usually the mid-year population), and then multiplying the result by 1,000. The crude birth rate is influenced by a variety of social, economic, and cultural factors, including the age and sex structure of the population, levels of education (especially among women), access to contraception and family planning services, cultural norms and religious beliefs about family size, and economic conditions such as levels of development and urbanisation. A high crude birth rate generally indicates a younger population with high fertility levels, while a low crude birth rate may suggest an aging population or lower fertility rates due to factors like increased access to education and contraception, or changing societal norms. It is considered "crude" because it includes all people in the population in the denominator, regardless of their age or sex, and does not specifically account for the number of women of childbearing age, which is a more refined measure of fertility. Nevertheless, the crude birth rate is a widely used and easily understood indicator of population change and is essential for making comparisons across different populations and tracking demographic trends over time.</Literal>

Similar to the crude birth rate, it is a basic but widely used measure in demography that provides an overview of the mortality level within a population during a specific year. The crude death rate is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths recorded in a year by the total population (usually the mid-year population) and then multiplying the result by 1,000. This rate is influenced by various factors such as the age structure of the population (populations with a higher proportion of older people tend to have higher crude death rates), levels of healthcare and sanitation, prevalence of diseases, nutritional status, environmental conditions, and socioeconomic factors. A high crude death rate can indicate a population with poor health conditions, high levels of poverty, or a large proportion of elderly individuals, while a low crude death rate may suggest better healthcare, sanitation, and a younger population structure. Like the crude birth rate, the crude death rate is considered "crude" because it does not take into account the age and sex composition of the population, which can significantly affect mortality levels. For instance, a population with a large number of young people might have a lower crude death rate even if the mortality rates for specific age groups are relatively high. Despite this limitation, the crude death rate is a valuable tool for comparing mortality levels across different populations and for monitoring changes in mortality trends over time.</Literal>

Bourdieu identified three forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalised. Embodied cultural capital exists in the form of knowledge and skills that are consciously acquired and passively inherited, such as language proficiency, manners, tastes, and dispositions. These are often learned through socialisation within a particular social class or cultural environment. Objectified cultural capital refers to cultural goods such as books, artworks, musical instruments, and other material objects that can be owned and transmitted. However, the possession of these objects is not sufficient; one must also have the cultural competence to understand and appreciate them to fully benefit from this form of capital. Institutionalised cultural capital consists of academic credentials, professional qualifications, and other forms of formal recognition that legitimate an individual's cultural competence and confer social advantages in the labor market and other social institutions. Cultural capital plays a significant role in social reproduction, as individuals from privileged backgrounds often possess more cultural capital, which helps them succeed in educational systems and gain access to higher-status occupations, thereby perpetuating social inequalities across generations.</Literal>

This diversity contributes to the multifaceted nature of human society, reflecting the myriad ways in which people organise their lives, understand the world, and express themselves. Cultural diversity is often celebrated for enriching society by fostering innovation, creativity, a broader range of perspectives, and a more vibrant cultural landscape, thereby enhancing cultural vitality and mutual understanding. However, it can also present challenges related to social cohesion, intergroup relations, and potential conflicts arising from differing values, competing interests, or the historical legacies of power imbalances and discrimination. Sociologists study cultural diversity to understand how different groups maintain their distinct identities while interacting within a larger social framework, and how societies manage diversity to promote inclusion, equality, and social harmony, moving beyond assimilationist models towards valuing cultural pluralism and multiculturalism, and addressing issues like prejudice and segregation.</Literal>

For example, the core values of a society might be reflected in its laws, its educational system, its religious beliefs, and its everyday customs. When cultural integration is high, there is a greater degree of consensus and shared understanding among members of the society regarding how to behave and what is considered important. This can contribute to social cohesion and stability. However, no culture is perfectly integrated, and there can often be tensions and contradictions between different cultural elements, particularly in diverse and rapidly changing societies.

This term was popularised by William F. Ogburn, who argued that material culture (such as technology) often changes more rapidly than non-material culture (such as values, beliefs, norms, and laws). When a significant gap develops between these two aspects of culture, it can create a period of maladjustment or social problems as the non-material culture struggles to adapt to the changes in the material culture. For example, the rapid development of the internet and social media has outpaced the development of social norms and laws to govern online behaviour, leading to issues such as cyberbullying, privacy concerns, and the spread of misinformation. Cultural lag highlights the dynamic and sometimes uneven nature of cultural change and the challenges societies face in adapting their values and social structures to new technologies and other material innovations.</Literal>

In a culturally pluralistic society, different ethnic, racial, religious, and other cultural groups are able to maintain their unique identities, traditions, and practices while participating fully in the broader society. This is often contrasted with assimilation, where minority groups are expected to adopt the culture of the dominant group. Cultural pluralism emphasises the value of diversity and the benefits of having a society enriched by multiple perspectives and traditions. It requires a degree of tolerance and mutual respect among different cultural groups and often involves policies and practices that protect the rights and promote the inclusion of all cultural groups within the society. The concept of a "salad bowl" is often used as a metaphor for cultural pluralism, where different ingredients (cultures) are mixed together but retain their individual flavors and characteristics, rather than being completely blended into a single entity like in a "melting pot" (often used to describe amalgamation).</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Cultural relativism is a principle in social science that emphasises the viewing of people's behaviour from the perspective of their own culture, rather than judging it based on the standards of another culture. It suggests that different cultures have different norms, values, beliefs, and practices that are meaningful and functional within their own context. Therefore, to understand and analyse human behaviour, it is essential to consider the cultural framework in which it occurs. Cultural relativism encourages an attitude of openness and understanding towards cultural differences, helping to avoid ethnocentrism, which is the tendency to view one's own culture as superior and to judge other cultures based on one's own cultural norms. While cultural relativism is important for promoting cross-cultural understanding and tolerance, it does not necessarily imply that all cultural practices are equally acceptable or morally justifiable. Sociologists often use cultural relativism as a methodological tool to study and describe different cultures without imposing their own cultural biases.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Cultural_Reproduction</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Cultural reproduction refers to the process by which a society transmits dominant knowledge, values, beliefs, and social inequalities from one generation to another. This transmission occurs through various social institutions, including the family, education system, media, and religion. Cultural reproduction theory, particularly associated with the work of Pierre Bourdieu and Basil Bernstein, highlights how the dominant culture in a society tends to be perpetuated, often reinforcing existing power structures and social hierarchies. For example, the education system may prioritise certain forms of knowledge and cultural capital that are more readily accessible to children from privileged backgrounds, thereby contributing to their continued success and the reproduction of social class differences across generations. Similarly, the media can play a role in shaping and reinforcing dominant ideologies and cultural norms. Understanding cultural reproduction helps sociologists analyse how social inequalities are maintained and transmitted over time, even in the absence of overt discrimination.</Literal>

This process occurs through various mechanisms, including socialisation within the family, formal education in schools, informal learning from peers and community members, and exposure to media and cultural products. Language is a fundamental tool for cultural transmission, allowing for the communication of knowledge, history, and cultural values across generations. Traditions, rituals, and storytelling also play important roles in passing down cultural heritage. Cultural transmission is essential for the survival and development of societies, as it enables each new generation to learn from the experiences and knowledge of those who came before them, contributing to social stability and cultural evolution. The effectiveness of cultural transmission can influence the rate and direction of cultural change within a society.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Cultural universals are general practices, behaviours, and social institutions that are found in every culture across the globe, despite the vast differences that exist between them. These commonalities suggest fundamental aspects of human life and social organisation that are shared across diverse societies. While the specific forms these universals take can vary greatly from one culture to another, the underlying patterns are consistent. Examples of cultural universals include the presence of language and some form of communication, the existence of family structures (though their forms may differ), systems of social norms and rules governing behaviour, rituals and ceremonies (often related to birth, death, and marriage), some form of art or aesthetic expression (such as music, dance, or visual arts), and mechanisms for dealing with the supernatural or religious beliefs. The study of cultural universals helps sociologists and anthropologists identify core elements of human culture and understand the fundamental ways in which societies organise themselves to meet basic human needs and address common life experiences. The existence of these universals suggests that despite cultural diversity, there are underlying commonalities in human nature and social life.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Culture encompasses the values, beliefs, ceremonies, ways of life, norms, symbols, and material goods characteristic of a given group or society. Like the concept of society, the notion of culture is very widely used in sociology, as well as in other social sciences, particularly anthropology. Culture is one of the most distinctive properties of human social association, differentiating human societies from animal societies in its complexity and transmission through learning rather than solely through instinct. It includes everything that is learned and shared by the members of a society, shaping their behaviour and their understanding of the world. Culture can be broadly divided into material culture, which includes tangible objects created by a society (such as tools, technology, clothing, and art), and nonmaterial culture, which includes intangible aspects such as ideas, values, beliefs, norms, language, and social institutions. Culture provides a framework for social interaction, defines what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and gives meaning to people's lives.

This category groups concepts that help to analyse how culture operates, changes, or is interpreted within society. Examples include phenomena like cultural lag (the discrepancy between material and non-material culture change), cultural integration (the coherence among cultural elements), cultural reproduction (how culture is transmitted and perpetuated), and culture shock (personal disorientation from unfamiliar ways of life).

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Culture shock is the feeling of surprise and disorientation that is experienced when people witness cultural practices, values, norms, and beliefs that are significantly different from their own. This phenomenon typically occurs when individuals are immersed in a new and unfamiliar cultural environment, such as when traveling to a foreign country, moving to a different region within their own country with distinct cultural norms, or even when experiencing a significant change in social environment, like starting a new job with a very different organisational culture. The disorientation arises from the lack of familiar cues and expectations that guide behaviour in one's own culture, leading to feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, and sometimes even hostility towards the new cultural context. Culture shock can affect various aspects of daily life, including communication styles, social etiquette, food, customs, and even basic assumptions about how the world works. While often challenging, experiencing and overcoming culture shock can also lead to personal growth, increased cultural awareness, and a deeper understanding of both one's own culture and others. The process of adapting to a new culture involves learning new norms, values, and behaviours, and gradually adjusting one's own perspectives and practices to fit the new environment.</Literal>

These crimes exploit the digital realm to commit offenses that can range from individual acts to large-scale organised operations. Emergent forms of cybercrime include electronic money laundering, which involves concealing the origins of illegally obtained money through digital transactions; personal identity theft, where an individual's personal information is stolen and used for fraudulent purposes; electronic vandalism, which involves damaging or disrupting computer systems or data; and the monitoring of electronic correspondence, such as hacking into email accounts or intercepting online communications. Other common types of cybercrime include phishing scams, malware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and the distribution of illegal content. The borderless nature of cyberspace makes cybercrime particularly challenging to investigate and prosecute, often requiring international cooperation among law enforcement agencies. The increasing reliance on digital technologies in all aspects of life has made cybercrime a significant and growing concern for individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">The death rate, also known as the crude death rate, is the number of deaths per 1,000 population in a given year. It is a fundamental demographic indicator that measures the mortality level of a population. The crude death rate is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths recorded in a year by the total population (usually the mid-year population estimate) and then multiplying the result by 1,000. This rate is influenced by various factors, including the age structure of the population (a population with a larger proportion of elderly individuals will typically have a higher death rate), the prevalence of diseases, levels of healthcare and sanitation, nutritional standards, environmental conditions, and socioeconomic factors. A high death rate can indicate a population facing health crises, poverty, or a large elderly population, while a low death rate may suggest better health conditions and a younger population structure. Like the crude birth rate, the crude death rate is considered "crude" because it does not account for the age and sex distribution of the population, which can significantly affect mortality rates. However, it provides a useful overall measure for comparing mortality levels across different populations and tracking changes over time.</Literal>

This concept highlights the social construction of neighborhood boundaries and the sense of territoriality and identity that residents develop in relation to their local area. Residents of a defended neighborhood often feel a strong sense of belonging and may actively work to maintain the perceived social and physical boundaries of their community, sometimes in response to perceived threats or differences from neighboring areas. This can involve social activities, community organisations, and even informal surveillance to reinforce the neighborhood's identity and distinctiveness. The concept of a defended neighborhood is relevant to understanding urban sociology, community studies, and issues related to social cohesion and inter-neighborhood relations.

It involves the clearing or removal of forests and woodlands, leading to a reduction in the area covered by trees. Deforestation has significant environmental consequences, including habitat loss for countless plant and animal species, soil erosion, disruption of water cycles, increased greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change, and reduced biodiversity. The drivers of deforestation are complex and often interconnected, involving economic pressures, population growth, and unsustainable land management practices. While logging can provide timber for various uses and agriculture can create land for food production, when these activities are not managed sustainably, they can lead to widespread deforestation with long-lasting negative impacts on ecosystems and human societies. Efforts to combat deforestation include promoting sustainable forestry practices, reforestation initiatives, protecting existing forests through conservation efforts, and addressing the underlying economic and social factors that drive forest clearing.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">A degradation ceremony is an aspect of the socialisation process within total institutions, such as prisons, military boot camps, and mental hospitals, in which people are subjected to humiliating rituals and procedures designed to strip away their existing identities and self-concepts. The purpose of these ceremonies is to break down the individual's sense of self and replace it with an identity that is more compliant with the rules and expectations of the institution. These rituals can involve public shaming, the confiscation of personal belongings, the assignment of dehumanizing labels, and the enforcement of strict rules and routines that leave little room for individual expression or autonomy. The degradation ceremony marks the individual's entry into the total institution and signals the beginning of their resocialisation into the institutional culture. By systematically undermining the individual's former identity, the institution aims to create a blank slate upon which a new, institutionally defined identity can be inscribed. This process is a key mechanism through which total institutions maintain control and order over their populations.</Literal>

This process is often accompanied by a shift towards a service-based economy, with a greater emphasis on sectors like finance, information technology, and healthcare. Deindustrialisation can be caused by various factors, including technological advancements that automate production, the globalisation of manufacturing leading to production moving to countries with lower labor costs, and a shift in consumer demand towards services rather than manufactured goods. While deindustrialisation can lead to economic restructuring and the emergence of new industries, it can also result in job losses in the manufacturing sector, economic hardship for affected communities, and increased social inequality if new opportunities are not readily available or accessible to all. The social and economic consequences of deindustrialisation have been a significant area of study in sociology, with researchers examining its impact on employment, social class, and community well-being.</Literal>

These processes involve significant shifts in where and how people live, the age structure of populations, and the spatial distribution of economic and social activities. Urbanisation represents one of the most significant spatial transformations in human history, concentrating populations in cities and creating new forms of social organisation, economic coordination, and cultural life. This process fundamentally alters social relationships, economic opportunities, and environmental conditions. Demographic transition involves systematic changes in birth and death rates that reshape the age structure of societies and create new challenges and opportunities for social organisation. Greying represents a specific demographic transformation where societies experience significant increases in elderly populations, requiring adaptations in healthcare systems, social support networks, and economic arrangements. Gentrification illustrates how spatial transformation can involve the displacement of existing communities and the reconfiguration of urban social geography. These processes are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, as urbanisation often accompanies demographic transitions, while changing age structures influence spatial patterns of residence and community development. Understanding these processes is essential for analysing contemporary social challenges related to housing, community development, social services, and the sustainability of different forms of social organisation.</Literal>

This process involves a shift from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as a society develops economically and socially. The transition typically occurs in stages, as described in the demographic transition theory, moving from a period of high fertility and mortality to one of low fertility and mortality, with a period of rapid population growth in between when death rates decline before birth rates do. The end result is a stabilisation of the population at a new size, often larger than the pre-transition level, with a different age structure. Factors contributing to this transition include improvements in healthcare, sanitation, education, and changes in cultural norms and values related to family size.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Demographic transition theory is a thesis linking population patterns to a society's level of technological development, suggesting that as societies industrialise and modernize, they go through a predictable sequence of changes in birth and death rates. The theory typically outlines four or five stages. In the first stage (pre-industrial), both birth rates and death rates are high, resulting in a relatively stable and low population size. In the second stage (early industrialisation), death rates begin to decline due to improvements in sanitation, healthcare, and nutrition, while birth rates remain high, leading to rapid population growth. In the third stage (late industrialisation), birth rates also start to decline as societies become more urbanised, education levels rise (especially for women), and contraception becomes more widely available, resulting in a slowing of population growth. In the fourth stage (post-industrial), both birth rates and death rates are low, leading to a stable or even declining population size. Some versions of the theory include a fifth stage where death rates may slightly exceed birth rates, leading to further population decline. This theory provides a framework for understanding historical population changes and for making projections about future population trends based on a society's level of development.</Literal>

Key areas of study in demography include fertility (birth rates), mortality (death rates), and migration (the movement of people from one place to another). Demographic research provides essential information for governments, businesses, and other organisations for planning purposes, such as forecasting future population size, age structure, and geographic distribution, which can inform decisions related to healthcare, education, infrastructure, and social welfare programs.

Concurrently, it analyses the formal mechanisms of social control, such as law enforcement and the criminal justice system (police, courts, prisons, capital punishment), and informal mechanisms, like social approval or disapproval, peer pressure, and gossip, which maintain social order. The subfield also studies the consequences of deviance for individuals (e.g., stigma, rehabilitation) and society, and the interplay between deviance and social change.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Deviant_Subculture</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">A deviant subculture is a subculture whose members hold values, norms, beliefs, and behaviours that differ substantially from those of the majority or dominant culture in a society. These subcultures often emerge as a form of resistance or reaction to mainstream norms and may provide alternative ways of life and social identities for their members. Examples of deviant subcultures can include some youth gangs, radical political groups, or groups with unconventional lifestyles. The values and practices of a deviant subculture may be seen as negative or threatening by the wider society, leading to social stigma and conflict. Studying deviant subcultures helps sociologists understand the diversity of cultural expressions within a society and the processes through which certain behaviours and values come to be defined as deviant.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Diaspora refers to the dispersal of an ethnic population from an original homeland into foreign areas, often in a forced manner or under traumatic circumstances such as war, famine, or persecution. The term can also refer to the communities formed by these dispersed people in their new locations, who often maintain a sense of connection to their homeland and a shared cultural identity. Examples of diasporas include the Jewish diaspora, the African diaspora resulting from the slave trade, and the Armenian diaspora following the genocide. Diasporic communities often play a significant role in transnational networks, maintaining cultural traditions, and sometimes engaging in political or economic activities related to their homeland. The study of diasporas examines issues of identity, belonging, cultural adaptation, and the complex relationships between diasporic communities and both their homeland and their adopted countries.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Differential association is a theory of deviance proposed by Edwin Sutherland that holds that violation of rules results from exposure to attitudes favourable to criminal acts. This theory suggests that criminal behaviour is learned through interactions with others, particularly in intimate personal groups. Individuals learn not only the techniques of committing crimes but also the attitudes, values, and rationalisations that support criminal behaviour. The likelihood of engaging in deviance depends on the frequency, intensity, priority, and duration of an individual's association with those who hold deviant attitudes compared to those who hold conventional attitudes. Differential association theory emphasises the social learning aspect of deviance, suggesting that it is not simply the result of individual pathology but rather a product of social interaction and learning within specific social environments.</Literal>

This can occur through various forms of contact, including trade, migration, communication, and conquest. Cultural diffusion plays a significant role in cultural change, as societies are constantly borrowing and adapting elements from other cultures. The rate and extent of diffusion can be influenced by factors such as the compatibility of the new cultural item with existing cultural elements, the social status of the adopters, and the intensity of contact between the groups. Diffusion can lead to both cultural enrichment and cultural homogenisation, depending on the specific context and the nature of the cultural exchange.</Literal>

It examines how disability is defined, understood, and represented in society, often challenging medicalised and deficit-based models of disability that focus solely on individual impairments. Instead, disability studies emphasises the social model of disability, which posits that disability is primarily a result of societal barriers and attitudes that exclude and disadvantage people with impairments. This field also explores the history of disability activism and the ongoing campaigns by disabled people and their organisations to achieve equality, inclusion, and social justice. Disability studies is an interdisciplinary field drawing on sociology, anthropology, history, literature, and other disciplines to provide a comprehensive understanding of disability as a social phenomenon.</Literal>

In the context of culture and society, discovery can involve the identification of new elements of the natural world, the uncovering of existing but previously unknown knowledge, or the recognition of new ways of understanding or perceiving reality. Discoveries can have significant impacts on societies, leading to technological advancements, scientific breakthroughs, and changes in cultural beliefs and practices. Unlike invention, which involves creating something new, discovery involves finding or becoming aware of something that already exists.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Discrimination is the process of denying opportunities and equal rights to individuals and groups because of prejudice or other arbitrary reasons, often stemming from negative stereotypes and biases. This can manifest in various forms, including individual acts of prejudice and systemic or institutional discrimination embedded in policies and practices. Discrimination can target individuals based on a wide range of characteristics, such as age, sex, nationality, religion, skin color, disability, or physical appearance. It involves treating people unfairly or unequally due to their membership in a particular group, rather than based on their individual merits or abilities. The consequences of discrimination can be significant, leading to social exclusion, economic disadvantage, limited access to resources, and psychological harm for those who experience it. While overt forms of discrimination are often condemned, more subtle or indirect forms can persist and continue to perpetuate inequalities within society. Addressing discrimination requires not only legal and policy measures but also efforts to challenge underlying prejudices and stereotypes through education and awareness. The impact of discrimination can be particularly pronounced when individuals face multiple forms of discrimination based on intersecting aspects of their identity, such as age combined with gender, race, or disability.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Disengagement_Theory</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Disengagement theory is a functionalist theory of aging introduced by Cumming and Henry that contends that society and the aging individual mutually sever many of their relationships as the individual approaches death. This theory suggests that this mutual withdrawal is a natural and inevitable process that benefits both the individual and society. For the aging individual, disengagement allows for a peaceful transition out of social roles and responsibilities, reducing stress and providing time for introspection. For society, the disengagement of older individuals allows younger generations to take over positions of power and responsibility, ensuring social continuity and preventing disruption caused by the potential incapacity or death of older members in key roles. This theory has faced criticism for its assumption that disengagement is always functional and beneficial, as many older adults remain active and engaged in society and may experience negative consequences from forced or unwanted social withdrawal, such as loneliness and a decline in well-being. Alternative theories of aging emphasise the importance of continued social engagement and activity for maintaining health and life satisfaction in later years.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Documentary research is a method of data collection and analysis that involves the study of written texts and other documents, including personal diaries, government policies, fictional works, mass media output, historical records, and organisational reports. This type of research provides valuable insights into social phenomena, cultural values, historical trends, and individual experiences. Researchers using documentary methods analyse the content, context, and meaning of these documents to answer their research questions. Personal diaries and letters can offer rich qualitative data about individual lives and perspectives. Government policies and official reports can reveal institutional practices and societal priorities. Fictional works and mass media can reflect and shape cultural norms and ideologies. Historical documents provide evidence of past events and social structures. The strength of documentary research lies in its ability to provide access to information that might not be available through other methods, such as surveys or interviews, and to study phenomena over time. It is often used in historical sociology, media studies, and qualitative research to provide context and depth to sociological analysis.</Literal>

While offering some of the rights and benefits of marriage, domestic partnerships typically do not grant the full range of legal protections afforded to married couples under federal law. The criteria for establishing a domestic partnership can vary depending on the jurisdiction or organisation, often requiring a formal registration process. Domestic partnerships were initially established to provide recognition and benefits to same-sex couples before the legalisation of same-sex marriage, but they are also available to heterosexual couples who choose not to marry. The specific rights and responsibilities associated with domestic partnership can include healthcare benefits, inheritance rights, and the ability to make medical decisions for a partner. The rise of domestic partnerships reflects changing social norms and a broader recognition of diverse forms of intimate relationships.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Downsizing refers to reductions taken in a company's workforce as part of deindustrialisation or other economic restructuring efforts. This often involves laying off employees, eliminating positions, or offering early retirement packages to reduce the size of the organisation and lower labor costs. Downsizing can be a response to economic downturns, technological advancements that reduce the need for human labor, or a strategic decision to streamline operations and improve efficiency. While downsizing may benefit companies by increasing profits, it can have significant negative consequences for the affected workers and their communities, leading to job losses, financial insecurity, and social disruption. The social and economic impacts of downsizing are often studied by sociologists interested in the changing nature of work and the effects of economic restructuring on individuals and society.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Dramaturgical analysis is an approach to the study of social interaction based on the use of metaphors derived from the theatre, famously developed by sociologist Erving Goffman. This perspective views social life as a performance, with individuals as actors on a stage, constantly trying to manage the impressions they make on others. Key concepts in dramaturgical analysis include the "front stage," where individuals present themselves in formal and expected ways to an audience; the "back stage," where individuals can relax their public image and behave more spontaneously; and "impression management," the conscious or unconscious effort to control how others perceive us. Goffman argued that social interaction is a delicate balancing act where individuals strive to maintain face (a positive social identity) and avoid embarrassment or disruption of the performance. By analysing social interactions through the lens of theatrical performance, dramaturgical analysis provides insights into the ways individuals construct and present their identities in social settings.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">The dramaturgical approach is a view of social interaction, popularised by Erving Goffman, under which people are examined as if they were theatrical performers on a stage. In this perspective, individuals in social situations are seen as actors who present themselves and their roles to an audience (others present in the interaction). Just like actors in a play, people use props (material objects), scripts (established behaviours and routines), and costumes (appearance and demeanor) to convey particular images and create desired impressions. The goal of this performance is often to manage how others perceive them and to maintain a certain definition of the situation. Goffman emphasised the importance of "face-work," the efforts individuals make to maintain their own sense of dignity and the positive image they present to others, as well as to uphold the face of those they are interacting with. The dramaturgical approach highlights the performative nature of social life and the active role individuals play in shaping social reality through their interactions.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">A dyad is a two-member group, representing the smallest possible social group. Dyads are characterised by intense interaction and mutual dependence between the two members, as each person's participation is crucial for the group's existence. The intimacy and directness of interaction in a dyad can lead to strong emotional bonds, but also to potential instability, as the withdrawal or loss of one member dissolves the group entirely. Decision-making in a dyad is often more direct and personal compared to larger groups, as there are only two perspectives to consider. However, disagreements can be more challenging to resolve without the possibility of a third-party mediator. Dyads play a fundamental role in social life, forming the basis of many close relationships, such as romantic partnerships and close friendships. The unique dynamics of dyads have been a subject of interest in sociology, particularly in the study of small group interactions.</Literal>

In an ecclesia, there is typically no sharp distinction between the religious and secular spheres, and membership is often by birth rather than by conscious choice. The ecclesia tends to have a hierarchical structure and may exert significant influence over government policies and social norms. While the concept of ecclesia is less common in modern, pluralistic societies with a separation of church and state, historical examples include the Church of England or state-supported religions in some European countries. In sociological terms, ecclesia represents one end of a continuum of religious organisations, with sects and cults at the other end, and denominations falling somewhere in between.</Literal>

These processes involve comprehensive changes in how societies organise production, distribute goods and services, and structure economic relationships between different social classes and institutions. The transformation from traditional agricultural economies to industrial systems, and subsequently to post-industrial arrangements, represents one of the most significant social changes in human history. These processes are characterised by technological innovation, changes in labor organisation, shifts in the relationship between capital and labor, and the emergence of new forms of economic coordination and control. The Industrial Revolution exemplifies how technological advancement can trigger cascading social changes that reshape entire societies. Post-Fordism demonstrates how production systems continue to evolve in response to technological capabilities and market demands. Deindustrialisation shows how economic transformation can also involve the decline of previously dominant sectors, creating new challenges and opportunities. These processes fundamentally alter social stratification, work experiences, community structures, and the overall organisation of social life, making them central to understanding modern socioeconomic development.</Literal>

Conversely, it also investigates how environmental changes and challenges impact human societies, influencing social inequalities, migration patterns, health outcomes, and social conflicts. Environmental sociologists analyse the social causes and consequences of environmental degradation, the social movements advocating for environmental protection and justice, and the development of environmental policies and sustainable practices. This field often highlights issues of environmental justice, which addresses the disproportionate exposure of marginalised communities to environmental hazards. It emphasises a critical and systemic approach to understanding the human-environment nexus in a globalised world, often drawing on concepts like risk society and manufactured risk.Aging_Studies = Aging Studies is an interdisciplinary academic field dedicated to the comprehensive examination of the multifaceted process of human aging and the experiences of older adults within societal contexts. This domain draws insights from sociology, psychology, biology, demography, public health, economics, and policy studies to understand the physiological, cognitive, emotional, and social changes that occur throughout the life course, particularly in later life. It focuses on the social roles older people occupy, the challenges they face (such as ageism, health disparities, and retirement transitions), and the diverse societal responses to an increasingly aging global population. Researchers in Aging Studies investigate topics like social support networks, elder care systems, generational relations, healthy aging initiatives, and the broader impact of demographic shifts on social institutions and resource allocation. The field also addresses the social construction of old age and the cultural perceptions of longevity, aiming to inform public policy and promote well-being, social inclusion, and equitable opportunities for individuals across all life stages within society.

Esteem can be differentiated from prestige, which is a more general form of social honor and respect associated with one's social status or position in society, regardless of specific achievements. While prestige might be linked to factors like wealth, family background, or occupation in a broad sense, esteem is more specifically tied to how well an individual performs in their particular role or area of expertise and the recognition they receive for it from their peers and others in that domain.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">An ethnic group is a group of people who are set apart from others because of their shared national origin or distinctive cultural patterns, which can include language, religion, traditions, customs, and shared history. Members of an ethnic group typically share a sense of common identity and belonging based on these cultural elements, which distinguish them from other groups in society. Ethnicity is a social construct, meaning that it is defined and maintained through social interaction and cultural practices rather than being based on fixed biological traits. The boundaries of ethnic groups can be fluid and may change over time due to factors such as migration, intermarriage, and social and political contexts. The study of ethnic groups is central to understanding cultural diversity, intergroup relations, and issues of identity and belonging in sociology.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Ethnocentrism is the tendency to assume that one's own culture and way of life represent the norm or are superior to all others, leading to the evaluation of other cultures based on the standards and values of one's own culture. This can result in a biased or distorted view of other societies and their practices, often leading to misunderstandings, prejudice, and conflict. Ethnocentrism can manifest in various ways, from making negative judgments about the customs or beliefs of another culture to believing that one's own cultural practices are the only correct or natural way of doing things. While a certain degree of in-group preference is common in all cultures, extreme ethnocentrism can hinder cross-cultural understanding and cooperation. Sociologists strive to avoid ethnocentrism in their research by practicing cultural relativism, which involves understanding and evaluating other cultures from their own perspectives.</Literal>

Ethnographers aim to gain an in-depth understanding of the culture, behaviours, and social dynamics of the group being studied from the perspective of its members. This often involves the researcher spending a significant amount of time living among the people they are studying, participating in their daily activities, conducting interviews, and analysing cultural artifacts and symbols. The goal of ethnography is to provide a rich and detailed description of the social world of the group under study, capturing the nuances and complexities of their culture and social life. Ethnographic research is often used in anthropology and sociology to explore diverse cultural practices, social structures, and the meanings that people create and share in their everyday interactions.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">In sociology, evolutionary theory is a broad perspective that holds that society is moving in a definite direction of progress and increasing complexity over time, often drawing parallels to biological evolution. Early sociological thinkers like Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer applied evolutionary ideas to the development of human societies, suggesting that they evolve through stages from simpler to more complex forms, characterised by increasing specialisation, differentiation, and social organisation. While classical evolutionary theories often implied a linear and deterministic path of societal development, more contemporary approaches recognise that social change is more complex and can involve multiple pathways and even periods of regression. Modern evolutionary perspectives in sociology may focus on long-term processes of social change, the adaptation of societies to their environments, and the role of technological innovation in driving social evolution.</Literal>

The specific groups from which marriage is prohibited vary across cultures. The function of exogamy is often to promote social alliances and cooperation between different groups by creating ties of kinship through marriage. It can also help to prevent incest and maintain genetic diversity within a population. In many societies, the rules of exogamy are deeply embedded in cultural traditions and may be enforced through social sanctions or even legal prohibitions.

Experiments are a key method in quantitative research aimed at establishing causal relationships between variables. They typically involve an experimental group that is exposed to the independent variable and a control group that is not, with both groups being as similar as possible in all other respects, often achieved through random assignment of participants. By comparing the changes in the dependent variable between the experimental and control groups, researchers can draw conclusions about the causal impact of the independent variable.

The experimental group is compared to a control group, which does not receive the independent variable, to determine the impact of the manipulation. Researchers carefully design the experiment to ensure that the only systematic difference between the experimental and control groups is the presence or level of the independent variable, allowing them to infer causality if a significant difference in the dependent variable is observed. Random assignment of participants to the experimental and control groups helps to ensure that the groups are equivalent at the start of the experiment, minimizing the influence of confounding variables.</Literal>

This theory argues that racism and racial inequality serve the interests of the capitalist class by creating a split labor market, where workers are divided along racial lines, leading to lower wages for all workers and hindering the development of class consciousness and solidarity among the working class. By fostering racial antagonism, the bourgeoisie can maintain their power and profits by preventing the unified mobilisation of workers against their exploitation. Exploitation theory suggests that racial prejudice and discrimination are not simply matters of individual attitudes but are deeply embedded in the economic structure of capitalism and serve to perpetuate class inequality.</Literal>

This role is often traditionally associated with women in the family, involving providing emotional support, nurturing relationships, and managing interpersonal conflicts to ensure the well-being and cohesion of the group. Expressive roles focus on the affective and emotional needs of group members, contributing to social integration and solidarity. Parsons and Bales contrasted this with instrumentality, which refers to a focus on task-oriented goals, decision-making, and the external relationships of the group, often traditionally associated with men in the family.

Goffman argued that individuals are constantly engaged in presenting a particular "face" or social identity to others, and they actively work to maintain this face and to help others maintain theirs. Face-work involves various strategies, such as avoiding topics that might cause offense, offering apologies for social gaffes, and helping others to save face when they experience a social mishap. The goal of face-work is to ensure smooth social interaction and to uphold a shared sense of social order and respect among those present.

Answering factual questions is a fundamental part of sociological inquiry, providing the empirical basis for developing theories and understanding social phenomena. While seemingly straightforward, even factual questions can sometimes involve complex issues of data collection, interpretation, and the reliability of sources.

This false understanding prevents the working class from recognizing their own exploitation and their shared interests in overthrowing capitalism. Instead, they may adopt the values and beliefs of the bourgeoisie, seeing the existing social order as legitimate or even in their own best interest. Factors contributing to false consciousness can include the influence of ideology disseminated through media, religion, and the education system, which can mask the underlying power dynamics and inequalities of capitalist society. Overcoming false consciousness and developing class consciousness, an awareness of their shared exploitation and the need for collective action, is a crucial step in Marx's theory of social change.</Literal>

Key features of Fordism include the use of specialised labor performing repetitive tasks on an assembly line, the production of large quantities of uniform products, and the payment of relatively high wages to workers to enable mass consumption of these goods. This system led to significant increases in productivity and made consumer goods more affordable, contributing to the rise of a mass consumer society. However, Fordism has also been criticised for its dehumanizing aspects due to the repetitive nature of the work and its lack of flexibility in responding to changing consumer preferences.

Functionalists seek to understand how different social structures, such as the family, education, religion, and the economy, contribute to the maintenance of social order and cohesion.

It often involves a rejection of more liberal or interpretive approaches to religious texts and a strong insistence on faith-based answers to contemporary issues, defending tradition by appealing to what are considered to be the unchanging and absolute truths found in religious scriptures. Fundamentalist movements can be found across various religions and may manifest in different ways, including social activism, political engagement, and the establishment of separate communities adhering strictly to their religious principles.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Gender refers to the social expectations about behaviour that are regarded as appropriate for the members of each sex within a given culture. It is crucial to understand that gender does not primarily refer to the physical attributes that differentiate men and women biologically (sex), but rather to the socially formed traits of masculinity and femininity, which are learned through socialisation and vary across cultures and time periods. Gender encompasses the roles, norms, and identities that a society assigns to individuals based on their sex, influencing how they are expected to behave, interact, and present themselves. These social expectations shape everything from clothing and hairstyles to occupations and emotional expressions, and they play a significant role in structuring social relationships and hierarchies.</Literal>

This is distinct from sex assigned at birth, which is typically based on visible biological characteristics, and gender expression, which is how an individual outwardly presents their gender through clothing, behaviour, and other means. Gender identity is a fundamental aspect of an individual's sense of self and can align with or differ from their sex assigned at birth. The development of gender identity is a complex process influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. For many individuals, their gender identity is a core part of who they are and how they experience the world.</Literal>

This inequality is often manifested in various forms, including disparities in economic opportunities and earnings (such as the gender pay gap), political representation and influence, access to education and healthcare, and social and cultural norms that privilege one gender over the other, typically men. Gender inequality is a pervasive issue across many societies, although its specific forms and extent can vary significantly across cultures and historical periods.

It encompasses the dominant cultural beliefs and practices that construct and maintain gender hierarchies, often privileging certain forms of masculinity while subordinating femininities and marginalised masculinities. The gender order is not static but is constantly being negotiated and contested through social interactions and power struggles.

These roles are often labeled as masculine or feminine and are learned through the process of socialisation from a young age, influenced by family, peers, education, media, and other social institutions. Gender roles can vary significantly across different cultures and can change over time within the same society. While they provide a framework for social interaction and can contribute to a sense of identity, they can also be restrictive and contribute to gender stereotypes and inequalities by limiting individuals' opportunities and expressions based on societal expectations of their gender.

This concept is a key part of Mead's theory of the social self, explaining how individuals develop a sense of self through social interaction. As children mature, they move beyond understanding the expectations of specific individuals (like parents) to understanding the broader expectations of their community and society. This internalised understanding of the generalised other allows individuals to regulate their behaviour according to societal norms and to anticipate how others might respond to their actions, even in interactions with unfamiliar people.

It is considered the most extreme form of intergroup intolerance and a grave violation of human rights. Genocide can involve various methods of extermination, including mass killings, forced displacement leading to death, the imposition of measures intended to prevent births within the group, and the forcible transfer of children of the group to another group. The Holocaust, in which Nazi Germany systematically murdered approximately six million Jews, is a well-known historical example of genocide. Other instances include the treatment of aboriginal Australians by white settlers and the European colonisation of North America, which led to a drastic decline in Native American populations, partly due to the introduction of European diseases. The ongoing conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan has also been cited as a contemporary example of genocide.

This process typically involves the renovation of buildings, the influx of new businesses and amenities catering to a higher-income clientele, and an increase in property values and rents, making the area unaffordable for many of its long-term residents. While gentrification can lead to the physical improvement of neglected urban areas, it often raises concerns about social equity and the displacement of vulnerable populations, potentially leading to the loss of affordable housing and the disruption of established communities. The causes and consequences of gentrification are complex and have been a subject of much sociological research and debate, with discussions focusing on issues of urban planning, housing policy, and social justice.</Literal>

While the greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap the sun's radiation and warm the planet to a habitable temperature, global warming implies an acceleration of this effect due to the increased concentration of heat-trapping gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, released by human actions like the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. The potential consequences of unchecked global warming are far-reaching and potentially devastating, including significant changes to the world's climate patterns, leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, heatwaves, and storms, as well as rising sea levels, disruptions to ecosystems, and threats to human health and well-being. Understanding the causes and impacts of global warming is a critical area of sociological inquiry, as it involves examining the social, economic, and political factors that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and the ways in which societies can respond to this global challenge through mitigation and adaptation strategies.</Literal>

These theories typically seek to understand the underlying principles and structures that shape human behaviour, social interactions, and the evolution of societies over time. Karl Marx's theory of successive class conflicts as the driving force of history, leading to the eventual overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society, is a classic example of grand theorizing, attempting to explain the trajectory of human social development through the lens of economic and material forces. Other examples of grand theories include Talcott Parsons's structural functionalism, which views society as a complex system striving for equilibrium, and Immanuel Wallerstein's world-systems theory, which analyses global inequality in terms of a core-periphery model. While grand theories aim to provide comprehensive explanations, they have also been critiqued for being overly abstract, difficult to test empirically, and sometimes too broad to account for the diversity and complexity of social phenomena.</Literal>

This natural process is essential for keeping the Earth's temperature at a level that can support life. However, the term 'greenhouse effect' is often used in the context of global warming to refer to an enhanced greenhouse effect resulting from the build-up of high concentrations of greenhouse gases due to human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes. This increase in greenhouse gases traps more heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in the Earth's average temperature, a phenomenon known as global warming, which has significant implications for climate patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems worldwide.</Literal>

This effect was first observed during a series of industrial experiments conducted at the Hawthorne Works factory of Western Electric in the 1920s and 1930s, where researchers found that workers' productivity increased not only in response to changes in working conditions (like lighting) but also when changes were reversed or even when no changes were made, seemingly because the workers were aware they were being observed and were responding to the attention they were receiving. The Hawthorne effect poses a challenge for researchers as it can confound the results of studies if participants' awareness of being studied influences their behaviour in unintended ways, making it difficult to determine the true effect of the independent variable. Researchers often try to minimise the Hawthorne effect through various methodological strategies, such as using blind or double-blind study designs or by observing participants unobtrusively.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">The hidden curriculum refers to the unstated or subtle standards of behaviour, attitudes, values, and beliefs that are deemed proper by society and are taught implicitly in schools through the everyday practices, routines, and social interactions within the educational environment, rather than through the formal academic curriculum. This can include learning about punctuality, obedience to authority, competition, conformity to rules, and the importance of social hierarchies. The hidden curriculum plays a significant role in the socialisation of students, shaping their understanding of social norms, expectations, and power dynamics in ways that may not be explicitly stated but are nonetheless influential in preparing them for their roles in the broader society and the workplace. Sociologists study the hidden curriculum to understand how schools contribute to the reproduction of social inequalities and the transmission of dominant cultural values.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Historical and Cultural Context refers to the specific historical periods, social conditions, and cultural settings that profoundly influence and shape social phenomena, human behaviour, and the meanings individuals attach to their experiences within a society. This meta-category emphasises that sociological concepts and social realities are not universal or static but are deeply embedded in and understood through the lens of their unique historical trajectories and prevailing cultural norms, values, beliefs, and practices. For example, concepts like colonialism, underdevelopment, modernisation, and globalisation can only be fully grasped by considering the historical eras and cultural frameworks in which they occurred and continue to evolve. This contextual understanding helps to explain the diversity of social structures, institutions, and processes across different societies and over time, highlighting how past events and cultural legacies shape present social realities and future possibilities.</Literal>

This approach emphasises the interconnectedness of these different aspects of well-being and aims to treat the root causes of illness by addressing the individual's overall health and lifestyle. Holistic practitioners may use a variety of therapeutic modalities, including lifestyle changes, stress reduction techniques, nutritional guidance, exercise programs, and complementary and alternative therapies, in addition to conventional medical treatments, to promote healing and well-being. The focus is on treating the individual as a whole and empowering them to take an active role in their own health and healing process.</Literal>

These societies typically use simple hand tools, such as hoes and digging sticks, to cultivate small plots of land for subsistence. Unlike agrarian societies that employ more advanced agricultural technologies like plows and irrigation, horticultural societies generally have a lower level of technological development and a less intensive form of agriculture. Horticultural societies often practice slash-and-burn agriculture, where vegetation is cleared and burned to create fertile land for planting, which is then abandoned after a few years as the soil becomes depleted, and the group moves to a new area.

These societies typically have a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle, moving from place to place in search of food and resources as they become seasonally available. They generally have a small population size and a relatively simple social structure with a minimal division of labor, often based on age and sex. Hunting-and-gathering was the primary mode of subsistence for humans throughout most of history, and some relatively isolated groups continue to practice this way of life today.

It represents the idealised version of a society's culture, encompassing the goals, aspirations, and moral principles that are formally taught, celebrated, and often enshrined in laws and official documents. Ideal culture provides a set of guidelines for how people should behave and what they should value. However, it often stands in contrast to "real culture," which refers to the actual social patterns and behaviours observed in everyday life that may deviate from or only partially approximate these idealised expectations. The discrepancy between ideal and real culture can be a source of social tension, hypocrisy, or calls for social change, as individuals and groups navigate the gap between espoused ideals and lived realities.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">An ideal type is a conceptual construct or model that serves as a measuring rod or analytical tool against which specific cases can be evaluated and compared. The concept was developed by Max Weber, who emphasised that an ideal type is not meant to represent a perfect or desirable state, nor is it a statistical average of real-world cases. Instead, it is a deliberately constructed analytical abstraction that exaggerates certain features of a social phenomenon to highlight its essential characteristics and to provide a framework for understanding variations and similarities in empirical cases. For example, Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy outlines the key characteristics of a perfectly rational and efficient bureaucratic organisation, which can then be used to analyse and compare real-world bureaucracies that may deviate from this ideal in various ways. Ideal types are valuable tools for sociological analysis, helping researchers to clarify concepts, identify patterns, and develop theoretical insights.</Literal>

This area examines the self as a social construct, exploring the processes through which individuals become self-aware and form their personal identity (self-identity), encompassing their conscious perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about themselves. Key concepts include George Herbert Mead's theory of the social self, which differentiates between the "I" (the spontaneous, acting self) and the "me" (the socialised self, reflecting internalised societal perspectives, including those of significant others and the generalised other). This domain also delves into various facets of identity, such as gender identity, sexual orientation, personality, and the impact of social roles, experiences, and social groups (in-groups, out-groups) on self-concept.

These processes involve both the internal psychological work of self-definition and the external social processes of role acquisition and performance. Self-identity formation involves the ongoing construction of personal identity through social interaction and self-reflection. Role-taking enables individuals to understand and adopt different social perspectives, facilitating effective social interaction and empathy. Anticipatory socialisation allows individuals to prepare for future roles and social positions before actually occupying them. Role exit involves the complex process of disengaging from established roles and reconstructing identity. Ageing encompasses the broader life course changes that affect identity and role transitions over time. These processes demonstrate the fluid and dynamic nature of social identity, showing how individuals actively construct and reconstruct their sense of self in response to changing social circumstances and life transitions.</Literal>

Individuals engage in impression management to control how others perceive them and to project a desired image or definition of the situation. This involves strategically using language, nonverbal cues, behaviour, and props to convey a particular identity or role. Goffman's dramaturgical approach views social life as a performance, and impression management is a key aspect of this performance, as individuals strive to present a "face" that is appropriate to the social context and that will be accepted by others. The goal of impression management can be to gain approval, build trust, assert authority, or achieve other social objectives.</Literal>

Symbolic interactionism emphasises how individuals create meaning through social interaction and shared symbols. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis explores how language shapes thought and perception, while sociobiology investigates biological foundations of social behaviour. Cornucopian theory represents optimistic views of human adaptability and innovation, and multiple-nuclei theory examines urban development patterns from a more localised perspective.

It moves from the specific to the general, where patterns, similarities, or regularities observed in individual cases are used to formulate more encompassing conclusions or hypotheses about a larger population or phenomenon. For example, if a researcher observes that in several instances, increased levels of education are associated with higher income, they might use inductive reasoning to develop a general theory suggesting a positive relationship between education and income in the broader population. Inductive reasoning is a fundamental approach in empirical research, where data collection and analysis of specific cases often serve as the foundation for building sociological theories and understanding social patterns. While inductive conclusions are based on evidence, they are probabilistic rather than certain, as there is always the possibility that future observations might not fit the established pattern.</Literal>

Degradation ceremonies represent ritualised processes designed to strip away existing identities as part of institutional control mechanisms. Adoption creates new family relationships and identities through legal and social recognition. Self-fulfilling prophecy demonstrates how social expectations can shape individual outcomes and identity formation through dynamic interaction between beliefs and behaviour. These processes highlight the power of social institutions and significant life events to fundamentally reshape individual identity and social relationships, often involving elements of both social control and personal transformation that extend beyond routine socialisation experiences.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Institutional discrimination refers to the denial of opportunities and equal rights to individuals and groups that results from the normal operations of a society's institutions, such as schools, workplaces, healthcare systems, and the legal system, rather than from overt acts of individual prejudice. This form of discrimination is often embedded in established policies, procedures, and practices that may appear neutral on the surface but systematically disadvantage certain groups based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. For example, standardised testing in education that is culturally biased may disproportionately disadvantage students from certain minority groups, limiting their access to higher education. Similarly, hiring practices that rely heavily on personal networks may exclude qualified candidates who lack connections to the dominant group within an industry. Institutional discrimination can be subtle and often unintentional, but its cumulative effect can be significant in perpetuating social inequalities.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Instrumentality is a term used by sociologists Talcott Parsons and Robert Bales in their functionalist analysis of social roles, particularly within the family, to refer to an emphasis on tasks, a focus on more distant goals, and a concern for the external relationship between one's family and other social institutions, such as the workplace or the school system. This role is often traditionally associated with the male head of the household in a nuclear family structure, involving responsibilities such as economic provision, decision-making regarding external affairs, and maintaining the family's position within the broader social context. Instrumentality focuses on the practical and goal-oriented aspects of family functioning, ensuring that the family unit can meet its material needs and navigate its interactions with the outside world. Parsons and Bales contrasted instrumentality with expressiveness, which focuses on the emotional well-being and internal harmony of the family.</Literal>

These groups advocate for specific issues or the interests of their members by lobbying government officials, raising public awareness, and mobilizing support for their cause. Interest groups can represent a wide range of concerns, including economic interests (e.g., business associations, labor unions), social issues (e.g., environmental groups, civil rights organisations), and professional interests (e.g., medical associations, bar associations). They play a significant role in the political process by providing information to policymakers, contributing to political campaigns, and putting pressure on elected officials to support their agendas. The activities of interest groups are a key aspect of understanding how public policy is shaped and the various influences at play in democratic societies.</Literal>

Upward intergenerational mobility occurs when children attain a higher social status than their parents, while downward intergenerational mobility occurs when children experience a decline in social status compared to their parents. The degree of intergenerational mobility in a society is often seen as an indicator of its openness and equality of opportunity. High levels of intergenerational mobility suggest that individuals' social outcomes are less dependent on their family background, while low levels indicate that social status tends to be reproduced across generations. Sociologists study intergenerational mobility to understand the factors that facilitate or hinder social movement between generations and the extent to which individuals can improve their social standing through their own efforts.</Literal>

Interviews can be structured, following a predetermined set of questions in a specific order, or unstructured, allowing for more open-ended conversation and exploration of topics. Semi-structured interviews combine elements of both approaches, using an interview guide with key questions but allowing for flexibility in probing responses and exploring related issues that may arise. Interviews are a valuable tool for gathering in-depth qualitative data about individuals' experiences, perspectives, attitudes, and beliefs, providing rich insights into social phenomena that may not be captured by quantitative methods like surveys. The success of an interview depends on the researcher's ability to establish rapport with the respondent, ask clear and unbiased questions, and actively listen to and record their responses accurately.</Literal>

This type of social mobility focuses on the changes in a person's social standing, such as their occupation, income, or social class, that occur during their working years, as opposed to intergenerational mobility, which examines changes across generations. For example, an individual who starts their career in a lower-paying job and through promotions and career advancement rises to a higher-level position with increased income and prestige has experienced upward intragenerational mobility. Conversely, someone who experiences job loss or a decline in their career leading to a lower social status has experienced downward intragenerational mobility. The study of intragenerational mobility helps sociologists understand the factors that influence an individual's social trajectory over their lifetime, such as education, skills, career choices, and economic conditions.</Literal>

This theory emphasises the role of social reaction and the application of labels in the creation of deviance. It suggests that deviance is not inherent in an act itself but rather is a social construct defined by how society responds to certain behaviours and individuals. When individuals are labeled as deviant by political authorities or other influential groups, this label can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to further deviant behaviour as the labeled individuals internalise the label and are treated accordingly by others. Labeling theory highlights the power of social definitions and the consequences of being labeled as deviant for an individual's identity and life chances.</Literal>

This economic philosophy advocates for a separation of the state from economic affairs, believing that the natural forces of supply and demand, driven by self-interest and competition, will lead to the most efficient allocation of resources and the greatest overall prosperity. In a pure laissez-faire system, the role of government is typically limited to enforcing contracts, protecting private property rights, and maintaining peace and order, without imposing regulations, tariffs, subsidies, or other forms of economic control. The idea is that the "invisible hand" of the market will guide economic activity more effectively than state intervention.

Weber argued that social stratification creates disparities in life chances, with those in more privileged positions having greater access to resources like education, healthcare, safe housing, and quality employment, which in turn enhance their opportunities for a longer, healthier, and more fulfilling life. Conversely, individuals in disadvantaged social positions often face limited access to these resources, which can negatively impact their life trajectories and overall well-being.

While it can include positive aspects such as protectiveness towards family and a strong work ethic, machismo can also be associated with negative traits like aggression, sexism, and a rigid adherence to traditional gender roles that may limit both men and women. The concept of machismo has been the subject of sociological study, particularly in understanding gender relations, family dynamics, and cultural values within specific cultural contexts.</Literal>

These theories analyse how entire societies or global systems maintain stability, distribute power, and organise themselves structurally. Functionalist approaches within this category emphasise social equilibrium, institutional interdependence, and the mechanisms that maintain social order through shared values and norms. Power distribution theories examine whether control is concentrated among elites or distributed across multiple interest groups. World-systems theories explore global economic hierarchies and the interdependence of nations within capitalist structures. These macro-level perspectives share a common concern with understanding overarching social patterns, institutional arrangements, and systemic processes that shape entire societies or global systems, often emphasizing structural forces over individual agency in explaining social phenomena and change.</Literal>

It aims to understand the big picture of society, examining how institutions, social hierarchies, and global patterns shape social life and individual experiences. Examples of topics studied in macrosociology include the state, the economy, social class systems, globalisation, social change on a large scale, and the relationships between different societies. Major theoretical perspectives in macrosociology include functionalism and conflict theory, which both analyse society at a broad level.

This concept, developed by sociologist Robert Merton as part of his functionalist analysis, helps to understand the overt and deliberate purposes of social phenomena. For example, the manifest function of education is to provide students with knowledge and skills necessary for their future roles in society. Similarly, the manifest function of laws is to maintain social order and regulate behaviour. Identifying manifest functions is a key step in sociological analysis, as it helps to understand the intended goals and outcomes of social structures and actions. It is often contrasted with latent functions, which are the unintended and often unrecognised consequences of the same social patterns.</Literal>

These risks are often complex and may have unforeseen consequences due to the intricate interactions between human actions and natural systems. Examples of manufactured risk include global warming, which is largely attributed to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions; the potential hazards associated with genetically modified foods; the risks of nuclear power; and the unintended consequences of large-scale technological projects. Unlike natural risks, which may be perceived as external and unavoidable, manufactured risks often involve questions of responsibility, control, and ethical considerations related to human choices and their impact on the environment and society. The study of manufactured risk is important in sociology for understanding the challenges and uncertainties of modern, technologically advanced societies.</Literal>

The definition and practices of marriage vary significantly across cultures and have evolved over time, with changes in who can marry (e.g., same-sex marriage), the purposes of marriage (beyond procreation to include companionship and personal fulfillment), and the prevalence of different forms of marriage (e.g., monogamy, polygamy). Marriage often establishes kinship ties and defines rights and obligations between spouses and their families.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Marxist Theory is a comprehensive sociological and political theoretical framework stemming from the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which posits that societal development and social change are primarily driven by economic factors and class struggle. At its core, Marxist Theory asserts that in capitalist societies, there is an inherent conflict between two main classes: the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class who own the means of production) and the proletariat (the working class who must sell their labor power to survive). The theory argues that the bourgeoisie exploit the proletariat by extracting surplus value from their labor, which is the source of capitalist profit, leading to economic alienation and social inequality. Marxist Theory encompasses concepts like historical materialism (the idea that material conditions determine historical change), false consciousness (workers' inaccurate perception of their objective position), and class consciousness (workers' awareness of shared exploitation). It predicts that this class struggle will ultimately lead to a proletarian revolution, overthrowing capitalism and establishing a communist, classless society where the means of production are collectively owned.</Literal>

These media play a significant role in shaping public opinion, disseminating information, transmitting cultural values and norms, and providing entertainment. The development and widespread availability of mass media have had a profound impact on society, influencing everything from political campaigns and consumer behaviour to popular culture and social movements. Sociologists study mass media to understand its effects on individuals and society, including issues related to media ownership, content, audience reception, and the role of media in shaping social identities and perceptions of reality.

This method of production was a key outcome of the Industrial Revolution, particularly associated with the Fordist era of the early to mid-20th century, and it led to significant increases in efficiency and the availability of affordable consumer goods. Mass production relies on a high degree of division of labor and the use of interchangeable parts to streamline the manufacturing process. While it has been instrumental in driving economic growth and raising living standards, it has also been criticised for its potential to create monotonous and alienating work for employees and for its lack of flexibility in responding to diverse consumer demands. More recent trends in manufacturing include flexible production, which allows for greater customisation and variety.</Literal>

In a mass society, individuals may feel more isolated, anonymous, and disconnected from one another, with social relationships becoming more impersonal and instrumental. Traditional sources of social support and integration may weaken, potentially leading to feelings of alienation and a greater reliance on large-scale institutions like the state and corporations.

A master status can be ascribed (e.g., race, gender, disability) or achieved (e.g., profession, criminal record) and can be either positive (e.g., being a renowned scientist) or negative (e.g., being labeled as a criminal). The impact of a master status is significant because it often overrides other aspects of a person's identity and can influence their opportunities, social interactions, and life experiences. For individuals who belong to marginalised groups, a master status such as race or disability can lead to systemic discrimination and shape their social standing regardless of their other achievements or qualities.</Literal>

This perspective argues that the way a society produces its material necessities shapes its social relations and its overall organisation. Changes in the mode of production, such as the shift from feudalism to capitalism, are seen as the fundamental driving forces behind historical transformations, leading to new class structures and social conflicts that ultimately propel societal development.

This practice often occurs in societies with matrilineal descent systems, where kinship and inheritance are traced through the female line, but it is not exclusively tied to such systems. Matrilocality can offer several advantages, such as providing support for the new couple from the wife's kin, facilitating childcare by grandparents and other female relatives, and strengthening the social and economic bonds within the wife's extended family. It can also influence the balance of power within the marriage and the wider family network, potentially giving more prominence or authority to the wife's lineage. This pattern of residence is one of the ways that societies organise post-marital living arrangements, with other common patterns being patrilocality (living with or near the husband's family) and neolocality (establishing an independent household).</Literal>

For example, one might calculate the mean income of a population by adding up the incomes of all individuals and dividing by the total number of individuals. While the mean is a useful measure, it can be influenced by extreme values (outliers) in the data, which may not accurately represent the central tendency in some cases.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Mechanical Solidarity, a foundational concept developed by Ã‰mile Durkheim, describes a type of social cohesion and integration characteristic of traditional, pre-industrial societies. In such societies, social bonds are based on a high degree of homogeneity, where individuals share similar values, beliefs, customs, and engage in similar types of labor. This similarity leads to a strong collective consciousness or a common understanding of social norms and expectations, which binds people together through their likeness and shared experiences. Social order in societies with mechanical solidarity is maintained through the strong social pressure to conform to these uniform norms and values, and deviance is often met with harsh punitive sanctions to reinforce the collective morality. This form of solidarity fosters a powerful sense of community and belonging, where individuals feel deeply connected to one another through their shared identity and way of life, with relatively little individual autonomy compared to more modern societies.</Literal>

For example, in a distribution of incomes where a few individuals have very high incomes, the median income often provides a more representative measure of what is typical compared to the mean income. Calculating the median involves arranging the data in order and finding the central value; if there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.</Literal>

The history of miscegenation is intertwined with issues of race, racism, and the social construction of racial categories, and laws prohibiting interracial marriage have been challenged and overturned in many parts of the world as discriminatory and unconstitutional.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Mixed methods refers to the use of both quantitative (numerical data and statistical analysis) and qualitative (non-numerical data such as interviews and observations) research methods as part of a single research study to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the research question. This approach recognises that different methods have different strengths and limitations and that combining them can offer richer insights than relying on a single method alone. For example, a researcher might use quantitative surveys to gather data on the prevalence of a certain attitude in a population and then conduct qualitative interviews to explore the underlying reasons and experiences related to that attitude in more depth. Mixed methods research can enhance the validity and reliability of findings by triangulating data from different sources and providing a more holistic view of the phenomenon under investigation.</Literal>

In other words, it is the most frequent observation in a distribution. The mode can be a helpful way of portraying central tendency, particularly for categorical data or when a dataset has a clear peak or concentration of values. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode if all values occur with the same frequency. For example, in a survey asking about preferred colors, the mode would be the color that was chosen by the largest number of respondents. While the mode is easy to identify, it may not always be a unique or stable measure of central tendency, especially in small datasets or those with a wide range of values.</Literal>

This process typically involves significant changes in various aspects of social life, including the economy (shift from agriculture to industry), political systems (often towards democracy and increased state capacity), social structures (greater social mobility and differentiation), cultural values (emphasis on individualism, secularism, and rationality), and technology (adoption of advanced technologies). Modernisation is often associated with improvements in living standards, education, healthcare, and overall societal complexity, but it can also bring about social disruptions, inequalities, and challenges to traditional ways of life. Sociologists study modernisation to understand its causes, consequences, and the different paths that societies take in this transformative process.</Literal>

This theory suggests that development follows a linear path through distinct stages, from traditional to modern, and that less developed countries can achieve modernisation by emulating the paths taken by more developed Western nations. Modernisation theory often focuses on internal factors within developing countries, such as cultural barriers to progress, and advocates for the adoption of Western models of economic and political organisation. It has been influential in shaping development policies but has also faced criticism for its ethnocentric bias, its failure to account for historical and global power dynamics, and its assumption that all societies will follow the same path of development.</Literal>

In a monarchy, the monarch may hold absolute power (absolute monarchy) or their power may be limited by a constitution or other governing bodies (constitutional monarchy). Historically, monarchy was a prevalent form of government in many parts of the world, and while many monarchies have been replaced by other forms of government, some still exist today, often playing a symbolic or ceremonial role rather than wielding significant political power.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Monopoly refers to the control of a particular market or industry by a single business firm, giving that firm the power to dominate the market without significant competition. In a monopoly, the single firm is the sole producer or seller of a specific product or service, allowing it to set prices, control supply, and potentially limit consumer choice. This lack of competition can lead to higher prices, lower quality, and reduced innovation compared to markets with multiple competing firms. Monopolies can arise due to various factors, such as government regulations granting exclusive rights, the control of essential resources, high barriers to entry that prevent new firms from competing, or network effects where the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. While some monopolies may be considered natural due to inherent efficiencies of scale in certain industries, they are often subject to government regulation and antitrust laws aimed at preventing unfair competition and protecting consumer interests. The existence of a monopoly can have significant implications for the economy and society, affecting market dynamics, consumer welfare, and the distribution of wealth.</Literal>

Monotheism contrasts with polytheism, which is the belief in multiple gods, and atheism, which is the disbelief in any gods. The development of monotheistic beliefs has had a profound impact on the religious, philosophical, and ethical traditions of many cultures, shaping moral codes, worldviews, and social institutions.

This theory posits that a city may have several distinct centers of activity, each specializing in a particular urban need or activity, such as a retail district, a manufacturing area, a residential suburb, or a university campus. The development of these multiple nuclei is influenced by factors such as the availability of land, transportation routes, the clustering of similar industries or activities, and the avoidance of incompatible land uses.

It includes the abstract creations of human societies that are not embodied in physical objects. Non-material culture is just as crucial as material culture in defining a society's way of life and distinguishes human societies from one another. It is learned through socialisation and is transmitted across generations, forming the basis of cultural traditions and social order. Examples of non-material culture include religious beliefs, moral codes, customs, and systems of knowledge.</Literal>

These nonverbal signals can convey a wide range of emotions, attitudes, intentions, and meanings, often complementing, contradicting, or substituting for verbal communication. Non-verbal communication is a fundamental aspect of social interaction and plays a crucial role in how we understand and relate to others. Cultural norms can significantly influence the interpretation of nonverbal cues, leading to potential misunderstandings across different cultural contexts.</Literal>

This theory, developed by sociologist Charles Perrow, suggests that in such complex systems, multiple unexpected failures can interact in unforeseen ways, leading to accidents that are not simply the result of isolated errors but are a systemic outcome of the organisation and technology involved. The interactive complexity and tight coupling of these systems make it difficult to predict or prevent all potential failure combinations, leading to what Perrow terms "normal" accidents, meaning they are a normal, albeit infrequent, feature of such systems.</Literal>

It involves defining the concept in terms of the concrete, observable, and measurable indicators or procedures that will be used to represent it in a research study. For example, if a researcher is studying the concept of "happiness," an operational definition might be the score an individual reports on a standardised happiness scale, or the frequency with which they exhibit positive emotions during an observation period. Providing operational definitions is crucial for ensuring clarity, consistency, and replicability in research, as it specifies exactly how a concept will be measured and allows other researchers to understand and potentially replicate the study.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Organic Solidarity, a fundamental concept in Ã‰mile Durkheim's sociological theory, describes the form of social cohesion and integration that characterises modern, complex, and industrialised societies. Unlike mechanical solidarity, which is based on similarity and shared beliefs in traditional societies, organic solidarity arises from the interdependence of individuals and groups due to a highly specialised division of labor. In societies with organic solidarity, individuals perform diverse, specialised tasks and rely on each other to fulfill their needs and contribute to the overall functioning of society as an integrated whole. This mutual dependence, or functional interdependence, fosters social unity even in the absence of a strong collective consciousness or shared morality. Durkheim argued that organic solidarity is maintained through the regulation of these interdependent relationships, often through formal laws and contracts, and the recognition that each person's unique contribution is vital to the well-being of the collective, thereby allowing for greater individual autonomy within a larger social system.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Organisational_And_Societal_Rationalisation_Processes represents the systematic transformation of social institutions, organisational structures, and cultural practices toward greater efficiency, predictability, and rule-based coordination characteristic of modern societies. These processes embody Max Weber's central insights about the fundamental character of modernity, where traditional, emotional, or value-based modes of social organisation are increasingly replaced by rational, calculable, and bureaucratic approaches. Rationalisation manifests in the development of formal rules, procedures, and hierarchical structures that prioritise efficiency and systematic organisation over personal relationships or traditional authority. Bureaucratisation represents the institutional expression of this broader rationalisation trend, as organisations adopt formal hierarchies, specialised roles, and standardised procedures to manage complex activities. Modernisation encompasses the comprehensive social transformation toward rationalised institutions, technological advancement, and systematic approaches to social organisation. These processes fundamentally reshape how societies coordinate collective action, make decisions, and organise productive activities. While rationalisation has enabled unprecedented levels of social coordination and technological achievement, it also creates new forms of social control and can lead to what Weber termed the "iron cage" of bureaucracy. Understanding these processes is crucial for analysing how modern societies balance efficiency with flexibility, formal coordination with personal autonomy, and systematic organisation with creative innovation.</Literal>

These societies often have a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle, with a need to migrate between different areas according to seasonal changes in pasture availability or to seek fresh grazing lands for their herds. Social organisation in pastoral societies is often structured around kinship ties and the ownership and management of livestock, which can be a significant source of wealth and status.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Polygamy is a form of marriage in which an individual is legally or socially permitted to have more than one spouse simultaneously. It can take two main forms: polygyny, where a man has multiple wives, and polyandry, where a woman has multiple husbands. While monogamy (marriage to one spouse at a time) is the most common form of marriage globally, polygamy is practiced in some cultures and religions around the world, often with specific social, economic, or religious justifications.</Literal>

This interdisciplinary domain integrates statistical analysis with social theory to understand how populations change over time and space, examining fundamental demographic processes and their social implications. The field employs sophisticated methodological approaches to analyse population data, demographic transitions, and cohort effects across different societies and historical periods. These disciplines contribute essential knowledge for understanding societal transformations, resource allocation challenges, and the social consequences of demographic shifts. They provide critical insights into how population structures influence social institutions, economic systems, and policy development. The domain bridges quantitative demographic analysis with sociological understanding of how population changes affect social organisation, intergenerational relationships, and societal adaptation. This knowledge base is increasingly vital for addressing contemporary challenges related to population aging, demographic transitions, and the social implications of changing population structures in both developed and developing societies.</Literal>

Poststructuralists critically examine the underlying structures of meaning and power in society, rejecting the structuralist idea that there are fixed, universal structures that determine social phenomena. Instead, they argue that meaning is fluid, context-dependent, and constantly being constructed and deconstructed through language and discourse. Poststructuralism challenges the notion that absolute truths about the world can be definitively discovered, asserting that multiple interpretations of reality are inevitable and shaped by power relations and social contexts. It emphasises the instability of meaning and the importance of analysing how power operates through language and social practices.</Literal>

This broad category encompasses various forms, most commonly distinguished as absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty, also known as subsistence poverty, defines a condition where individuals lack the minimal resources required for basic survival, such as food, shelter, warmth, and safety, often measured by a fixed income threshold. Relative poverty, conversely, defines deprivation in relation to the living standards and average income levels of the majority within a particular society, implying social exclusion and a reduced ability to participate fully in customary activities. The feminisation of poverty highlights the increasing proportion of women among the poor. Poverty is a complex social problem influenced by economic systems, social inequalities, access to resources, and various structural and individual factors, leading to significant social and health consequences.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">A racial group is a category of people who are set apart from others within a society primarily because of obvious physical differences that are perceived as socially significant and are used to define group membership and often to justify differential treatment and social hierarchies. These perceived physical differences are not inherently meaningful but become socially significant when a society defines them as such and uses them as a basis for categorizing people and assigning them to different social positions, often leading to inequalities in power, privilege, and status. The concept of racial groups is closely tied to the social construction of race and the social processes of racialisation, where certain physical characteristics are imbued with social meaning and used to create racial categories that have real social consequences.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Racism is the attribution of characteristics of superiority or inferiority to a population sharing certain physically inherited characteristics, often leading to prejudice, discrimination, and the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over others. It is a complex system of power and ideology that operates at individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels, based on the social construction of racial categories and the belief that these categories are biologically real and associated with distinct traits, abilities, or moral character. Racism can manifest as overt acts of discrimination and hate speech, as well as in more subtle forms of bias embedded in social structures, policies, and practices that perpetuate racial inequalities in areas such as education, employment, housing, and the criminal justice system. It is a pervasive and harmful social phenomenon with deep historical roots and lasting consequences for individuals and societies.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Rationalisation is a concept extensively used by Max Weber to refer to the multifaceted process by which modes of precise calculation, efficiency-oriented organisation, and action based on abstract rules, laws, and procedures increasingly come to dominate the social world, replacing more traditional, emotional, or value-driven forms of social organisation and behaviour. This process is a central theme in Weber's analysis of modernity and is closely linked to the rise of bureaucracy, capitalism, and science. Rationalisation involves a shift towards systematic thinking, the application of reason and logic to social life, and an emphasis on predictability and control through formal structures and procedures. While it has led to advancements in technology, efficiency, and administration, Weber also cautioned about the potential negative consequences of rationalisation, such as the disenchantment of the world and the dominance of impersonal bureaucratic structures.</Literal>

Weber saw this process as a defining characteristic of modernity, influencing various aspects of social life, including the economy, law, politics, and religion, leading to the development of bureaucratic institutions and a focus on efficiency and instrumental reason. While rationalisation has brought about progress in many areas, Weber also warned of its potential negative consequences, such as the "iron cage" of bureaucracy and the loss of meaning and individual freedom.</Literal>

It emphasises the use of reason and logic to make decisions and solve problems, prioritizing efficiency and effectiveness in achieving specific objectives. Max Weber distinguished between different types of rationality, including instrumental rationality (focused on the efficient pursuit of goals), value rationality (guided by ethical or moral beliefs), traditional rationality (based on customs and habits), and affectual rationality (driven by emotions). The increasing dominance of instrumental rationality is a key aspect of Weber's theory of the rationalisation of society.</Literal>

For instance, if a survey reveals a high level of public support for a particular political party, this knowledge might lead some individuals to express their own support for that party, either to align with the perceived majority or because the information itself influences their opinion. Similarly, sociological research on the effects of labeling can lead to changes in how institutions approach and treat individuals labeled as deviant, potentially altering the outcomes for those individuals. Reflexivity highlights the dynamic and interactive relationship between social research and the social world it seeks to understand, emphasizing that sociological knowledge is not always neutral or detached but can have real-world consequences on social actions and perceptions.</Literal>

Beck argues that in modern society, the primary risks we face are increasingly manufactured risks, which are not attributable to natural disasters but are the result of human decisions, actions, and technological development, such as the risks associated with global warming, nuclear power, genetically modified organisms, and widespread pollution. These risks often transcend national borders and can have long-term and potentially irreversible impacts, leading to a heightened sense of uncertainty and the need for new forms of social organisation and political action to manage and mitigate these complex and often systemic risks.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Role exit is the social process through which an individual disengages from a role that has been central to their self-identity and establishes a new identity associated with a different role. This process often involves a period of adjustment and can be challenging as individuals may experience a sense of loss, uncertainty, or even identity crisis as they relinquish a familiar role and take on a new one. Examples of role exit include retirement from a long-term career, divorce leading to the end of the spouse role, or recovery from a serious illness leading to a change in one's identity as a "sick" person. Role exit typically involves stages such as doubt, search for alternatives, the turning point where the decision to leave the role is made, and the creation of a new identity.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Role taking is a fundamental social psychological process, particularly emphasised in the symbolic interactionist perspective, that involves mentally assuming the perspective, attitudes, feelings, and expectations of another individual or a group, thereby enabling one to understand how they might think, feel, and respond in a particular situation and to adjust one's own behaviour accordingly. This ability to take the role of the other is crucial for effective communication, social interaction, empathy, and the development of a sense of self, as it allows individuals to anticipate others' reactions and to see themselves from an external viewpoint. George Herbert Mead highlighted the importance of role taking in the development of the self, suggesting that through taking on the roles of significant others and the generalised other, individuals develop a sense of social self and learn to navigate social situations.</Literal>

This theory focuses on the situational factors that increase the risk of crime rather than on the motivations of offenders or broad social inequalities. A suitable target can be a person or object that is attractive to a potential offender, while capable guardianship refers to any factors that could prevent the crime from happening. The theory posits that changes in routine activities, such as people spending more time away from home or carrying valuable items in public, can influence crime rates by altering the opportunities for offenders to find suitable targets without the presence of guardians.</Literal>

The sacred is set apart from the ordinary and mundane aspects of everyday existence, which are considered profane. Ã‰mile Durkheim emphasised the fundamental distinction between the sacred and the profane as the basis of religious life, arguing that the sacred represents the collective beliefs and values of a society, fostering social solidarity and a sense of shared identity among members of a religious community. Rituals and ceremonies often revolve around the sacred, reinforcing its significance and the emotional bonds between believers.</Literal>

The key principle of sampling is to select a subset that is representative of the larger group, meaning that it accurately reflects the diversity and key attributes of the population of interest. Various sampling methods exist, including probability sampling techniques like random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling, which aim to ensure that every member of the population has a known chance of being selected, as well as non-probability sampling techniques like convenience sampling and snowball sampling, which may be used when a representative sample is not feasible or the research goals are exploratory.

It posits that the structure of a language affects its speakers' worldview or cognition, suggesting that the way people perceive and understand the world is, to some extent, determined by the language they speak. The strong version of the hypothesis argues that language completely determines thought, limiting the ways in which speakers can think about the world, while the weaker version suggests that language influences thought and habitual patterns of perception and cognition without being entirely deterministic. This hypothesis has been influential in linguistic anthropology and sociology, highlighting the close relationship between language, culture, and thought, although the extent of linguistic determinism remains a subject of ongoing debate.</Literal>

This stage of socialisation typically occurs during adolescence and adulthood, building upon the foundational learning acquired during primary socialisation. Key agents of secondary socialisation include schools (where individuals learn academic knowledge, punctuality, and conformity to formal rules), peer groups (influencing social behaviours, identity formation, and cultural trends), religious institutions (imparting moral beliefs and practices), and the workplace (socializing individuals into professional roles, organisational culture, and specific job responsibilities). Unlike the intimate and emotionally charged nature of primary socialisation, secondary socialisation often involves more impersonal and instrumental relationships, as individuals learn how to navigate diverse social settings and adopt appropriate behaviours for new roles and statuses in a complex society.

Sects often emphasise a more strict adherence to religious principles, may have a more exclusive membership, and can be characterised by a greater level of religious fervor and commitment among their followers compared to established churches. They may see themselves as a more authentic or purer form of the religion from which they originated and may have a more critical stance towards the wider society.

Secularisation can be observed and measured in various ways, including a decrease in levels of individual involvement with religious organisations (such as lower rates of church attendance and religious affiliation), a reduction in the social and material influence wielded by religious institutions in areas like politics, education, and social welfare, and a decline in the degree to which people hold traditional religious beliefs and adhere to religious practices in their personal lives. Secularisation does not necessarily mean the complete disappearance of religion, but rather a shift in its role and significance in society and individual lives, often leading to a greater separation between religious and secular spheres of life.</Literal>

While segregation can occur in various forms, it is frequently imposed on a minority group by a dominant group within a society, leading to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social institutions such as housing, education, healthcare, and employment. Segregation can be enforced through explicit laws and policies (de jure segregation) or through informal social norms and practices (de facto segregation). It often results in social isolation, limited intergroup contact, and the perpetuation of inequalities between the separated groups. The history of segregation in various parts of the world, such as racial segregation in the United States and apartheid in South Africa, demonstrates its profound and lasting negative impacts on marginalised groups and society as a whole.</Literal>

Mead defined the self as the sum total of an individual's conscious perceptions, feelings, and evaluations of their own identity as distinct from others in the social world. This sense of self develops through a process of social interaction that involves taking the role of the other, initially through play and games, and eventually by internalizing the attitudes and expectations of the broader society, which Mead referred to as the "generalised other." The self is thus a social construct, constantly being shaped and reshaped through ongoing interactions and the internal dialogue between the "I" (the spontaneous, acting self) and the "me" (the self as object, reflecting on how others perceive us).</Literal>

In other words, a belief or expectation, whether accurate or not, can influence behaviour in such a way that it makes the originally false belief come true. For example, if a teacher believes that certain students are less capable, they may treat those students in a way that inadvertently hinders their learning and confirms the initial low expectations. Similarly, if a person is labeled as deviant, they may begin to act in ways that are consistent with that label due to the way others treat them and their own internalisation of the label.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.</Literal>

It is characterised by shared values, common norms, mutual trust, and a willingness to cooperate for the collective good. Ã‰mile Durkheim identified two types of social cohesion: mechanical solidarity, found in traditional societies based on homogeneity and shared morality, and organic solidarity, prevalent in modern, complex societies based on interdependence and specialisation. High levels of social cohesion contribute to social stability, order, and collective well-being, fostering a sense of community and mutual support. Conversely, a lack of social cohesion can lead to social disorganisation, conflict, and a sense of anomie or normlessness among individuals.</Literal>

These theories reject harmonious views of society, instead highlighting how competing groups struggle over scarce resources, power, and status. Marxist and exploitation theories focus specifically on class-based conflicts within capitalist systems, examining how economic structures create and perpetuate inequality. Conflict perspectives extend beyond class to include racial, ethnic, gender, and other forms of social stratification. Contact hypothesis addresses intergroup relations and prejudice reduction, while new urban sociology examines how global forces create spatial inequalities in cities. These theories share the assumption that social change occurs through struggle and conflict rather than gradual adaptation, viewing inequality and competition as driving forces in social development.

In the context of deviance, this perspective argues that what is considered deviant is not inherent in a particular behaviour itself but rather is socially defined and labeled as such by particular groups or societies based on cultural norms, values, and power dynamics. The social construction of deviance involves processes through which certain behaviours come to be defined as unacceptable or abnormal, and individuals who engage in these behaviours are labeled as deviant, often with significant social consequences for their identity and life chances.

These mechanisms operate as realizable entities that can be activated when norm violations occur, representing the potential for societies to respond to threats to social order through both formal institutional responses and informal social sanctions. The category includes both the legal framework that provides formal rules and procedures for addressing deviance, as well as broader social control processes that operate through everyday interactions and community responses. These mechanisms demonstrate how societies balance individual autonomy with collective order, establishing boundaries of acceptable behaviour and consequences for transgression.

Discrimination and segregation involve systematic exclusion and differential treatment based on group characteristics. Sexual harassment represents processes of gender-based social control and victimisation. Hate crimes involve targeted violence based on group identity. Social exclusion encompasses broader patterns of marginalisation and systematic denial of participation in social life.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Social evolution is a theoretical perspective that was initially popular among nineteenth-century sociological scholars who sought to apply the principles of evolutionary theory from biology to the study of the long-term development and progression of human societies over time. These early social evolutionists often posited that societies develop through a series of fixed stages, moving from simpler, more primitive forms to more complex, advanced, and civilised states, drawing analogies to the biological evolution of species. While this unilinear view of social evolution, suggesting a single path of development for all societies, has largely been discredited in contemporary sociology due to its ethnocentric biases and lack of empirical support, the broader concept of social evolution still informs the study of long-term social change and the ways in which societies adapt and transform over extended periods in response to various factors such as technological innovation, environmental pressures, and intergroup interactions. Modern sociological approaches to social change recognise the multilinear nature of societal development, acknowledging that different societies can follow diverse paths and experience change in various ways, not necessarily leading to a single predetermined endpoint.</Literal>

These deprivations can include lack of adequate income and resources, limited access to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and social support networks, as well as experiences of discrimination, marginalisation, and a lack of voice or power in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Social exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and a diminished sense of belonging, hindering individuals' ability to exercise their rights, fulfill their potential, and participate as full and valued members of society. Addressing social exclusion requires tackling the various interconnected factors that contribute to it through inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and social integration for all members of society.</Literal>

Durkheim argued that these social facts have an objective reality and are not simply the product of individual psychology or biology, and therefore, they could and should be studied scientifically, using empirical observation and analysis to uncover the patterns and laws that govern social life. Examples of social facts include the institution of marriage, the education system, religious beliefs, and legal codes, which exist independently of any single individual but influence how people behave and organise their lives within a society.

In functionalist sociology, the focus is on understanding how different parts of society contribute to the whole and help to meet the needs of the social system. Social functions can be manifest, meaning they are the recognised and intended consequences of a social pattern, or latent, meaning they are the unintended and often unrecognised consequences. For example, the manifest function of education is to transmit knowledge and skills, while a latent function might be the development of social networks among students.

These structures represent the relatively stable backdrop against which political processes unfold, providing the institutional context that shapes how power is exercised, how conflicts are managed, and how social change occurs. The organisational dimension captures how societies develop systematic ways of coordinating collective activities, managing resources, and maintaining continuity across time, while the conceptual dimension provides the analytical tools necessary for understanding these complex arrangements and their effects on individual and collective behaviour.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Social_Organisations_And_Institutions encompasses structured collective entities that emerge from coordinated human activity to achieve specific purposes, maintain social order, and fulfill societal functions. These object aggregates represent formalised arrangements of individuals bound together by shared goals, authority structures, rules, and procedures that transcend individual participation. They include both voluntary associations formed for specific purposes and institutionalised entities that provide essential societal functions. The diversity within this domain reflects the complexity of modern social organisation, from small-scale voluntary groups to large-scale bureaucratic institutions. These aggregates demonstrate how individual human agency becomes channeled through collective structures to achieve outcomes that would be impossible through individual action alone, creating stable patterns of social organisation that persist across time and membership changes.</Literal>

This domain includes various types of formal organisations (e.g., corporations, bureaucracies, total institutions like prisons and monasteries) which are deliberately designed for efficiency and specific goals, characterised by hierarchical authority and established rules. It also covers the general concept of "organisation" itself, alongside specific types like "classical theory" management approaches (e.g., scientific management). Furthermore, it includes distinct social settings (e.g., front region, back region in dramaturgical analysis) and the dynamics that emerge within them. This category provides a framework for understanding how groups are structured, how individuals interact within these structures, and how organisational principles influence social behaviour, efficiency, and power relations in various societal contexts, from workplaces to broader societal settings.</Literal>

These are the fundamental ways in which individuals and groups interact, influence each other, and collectively create, reproduce, or transform social structures and cultural patterns. Key social processes include socialisation (learning norms and values), social interaction (how people act and react to each other), social change (significant alterations in society), and social control (mechanisms for regulating behaviour). Other processes involve social mobility (movement within stratification), migration (population movements), and deviance (norm violation). This category provides a framework for understanding the dynamic nature of social life, emphasizing that society is not static but constantly in flux through ongoing interactions, adaptations, and transformations that occur at micro, meso, and macro levels.</Literal>

This category encompasses the fundamental mechanisms through which societies organise human behaviour and social relationships, including both positions that individuals achieve through their actions and those that are ascribed based on characteristics beyond their control. The concept includes the hierarchical dimension of social positions through status systems and the specialised behavioural expectations associated with particular social positions. Gender roles represent culturally defined expectations based on sex categories, while the sick role exemplifies how societies organise responses to illness and health conditions. Master status refers to dominant identity categories that override other social positions in social interaction. The category captures how societies create and maintain social order through the assignment and performance of differentiated roles that coordinate individual behaviour with collective needs and expectations. These roles serve as bridges between individual identity and social structure, providing frameworks for social interaction, identity formation, and the reproduction of social patterns across time and social contexts.</Literal>

As a BFO disposition, this category captures the inherent propensities and latent capabilities that become actualised through social interaction and environmental triggers. It includes fundamental forms of social authority that represent dispositions to exercise legitimate power through traditional, charismatic, or legal-rational means. Sexual orientations and related identity dispositions reflect deep-seated tendencies toward particular forms of attraction and relationship formation. Cognitive and perceptual dispositions such as ethnocentrism, rationality, and sociological imagination represent characteristic ways of understanding and interpreting social reality. Economic dispositions include monopolistic tendencies and vested interests that shape market behaviour and resource control. The category encompasses both individual-level dispositions like bilingualism, expressiveness, and instrumentality, as well as structural dispositions that emerge from social positioning, such as life chances and the effects of push and pull factors in migration. These dispositions represent the underlying capacities and tendencies that, when activated by appropriate social conditions, generate observable social phenomena and behavioural patterns, serving as crucial explanatory mechanisms in sociological analysis.</Literal>

Mead argued that the self is not an innate characteristic but is socially constructed through a process of taking the role of the other, initially significant others like family members, and eventually the generalised other, representing the broader societal norms and expectations. Through these interactions, individuals develop a sense of who they are as distinct from others by seeing themselves reflected in the reactions and evaluations of those around them, leading to self-awareness and the ability to think about oneself as an object.</Literal>

Ã‰mile Durkheim, a foundational sociologist, distinguished two primary forms: Mechanical Solidarity, found in traditional, homogeneous societies, based on the likeness of individuals and a strong collective consciousness (shared values and beliefs). Organic Solidarity, characteristic of modern, complex societies, arises from the interdependence of individuals due to a highly specialised division of labor, where people rely on each other's specialised skills and contributions. Social solidarity is crucial for maintaining social order, stability, and cooperation, as it fosters trust, reciprocity, and a collective commitment to the group's well-being. A breakdown in social solidarity can lead to social disorganisation, anomie, and increased conflict within a society.</Literal>

The category includes specialised spatial concepts such as defended neighborhoods, which represent territorialised social spaces, and squatter settlements, which reflect informal urban development patterns. Virtual spaces are represented through cyberspace, acknowledging the increasing importance of digital environments in contemporary social life. The public sphere represents spaces dedicated to democratic discourse and civic engagement. Back regions refer to spaces where individuals can relax social performances and behave more informally. These spatial regions are not merely physical containers but are actively constructed through social processes, carrying cultural meanings, social rules, and behavioural expectations that shape how individuals and groups interact within them.</Literal>

While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, significant and enduring patterns of inequality, leading to hierarchical arrangements of social groups, tend to arise with the development of more complex, state-based systems. The most distinctive and extensively studied form of stratification in modern societies involves class divisions, based primarily on economic factors, but stratification can also occur along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and other social categories. Sociologists examine the causes and consequences of social stratification, as well as the processes that maintain or challenge these inequalities over time.</Literal>

These processes encompass both the general mechanisms of social mobility and specific patterns of movement within stratification systems. They include movement across different social strata as well as lateral movement within the same social level. These processes are fundamental to understanding how societies maintain or transform their inequality structures and how individual effort, social circumstances, and structural opportunities interact to shape social trajectories. They reflect the tension between social reproduction and social change, highlighting how societies balance stability with opportunities for advancement.

This theory posits that deviance is not inherent in the act itself but rather a consequence of the application of labels to certain behaviours and individuals by those in positions of power or authority. Once a person is labeled as deviant, this label can negatively impact their self-conception and limit their access to conventional opportunities, potentially leading to further deviance, a process known as deviance amplification. Early proponents like Howard Becker argued that social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction constitutes deviance and by applying those rules to particular people and labeling them as outsiders. The focus shifts from why individuals initially engage in certain behaviours (primary deviance) to the consequences of being labeled and internalizing that label (secondary deviance).</Literal>

Sociobiology seeks to understand how evolutionary principles and biological factors interact with social and environmental influences to shape patterns of social behaviour in both animal and human societies.

This perspective suggests that societies evolve and become more complex through processes of innovation, adaptation, and the accumulation of cultural capital, leading to transformations in social organisation, technology, economic systems, values, and beliefs. Unlike earlier, often deterministic theories of social evolution, more contemporary approaches recognise that sociocultural evolution is a complex, multilinear process influenced by a variety of factors, including environmental conditions, intergroup interactions, and internal dynamics within societies, and that it does not necessarily follow a fixed or predetermined path.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Sociological_Material_Entities encompasses concrete, tangible objects, institutions, and material arrangements that have sociological significance and serve as important components in social processes, relationships, and structures. This category includes both individual material actors and institutional arrangements that shape social life through their material properties and social functions. It covers technological infrastructure such as the Internet, which has fundamentally transformed social communication and interaction patterns. Material culture represents the physical objects and artifacts through which societies express and transmit cultural meanings and values. The category includes specific social roles with material dimensions, such as entrepreneurs who organise economic resources and professional criminals who operate within illegal economic markets. Institutional arrangements are represented through concepts like total institutions, which are material environments designed to control and reshape individual behaviour, and sweatshops, which represent specific forms of exploitative labor organisation. Research tools represent the material instruments through which sociological knowledge is produced and validated. These entities demonstrate the materiality of social life, showing how physical objects, spaces, and arrangements both shape and are shaped by social processes, serving as both constraints and resources for social action and organisation.</Literal>

Durkheim distinguished between two main types of solidarity: mechanical solidarity, found in traditional societies based on shared values, beliefs, and common experiences, and organic solidarity, prevalent in modern, complex societies characterised by a high division of labor and interdependence among individuals with different roles and functions. More generally, the term "solidarity" is often used, particularly by those on the left of the political spectrum, to describe the political consciousness, unity, and mutual support among members of an emerging class or group who are struggling against oppression or seeking to achieve common goals, such as working-class solidarity in the face of economic inequality.</Literal>

This domain integrates ecological thinking with sociological analysis to understand the complex interactions between social systems and their environmental contexts. It emphasises the mutual constitution of social and spatial relationships, recognizing that human societies both shape and are shaped by their physical environments. The field employs ecological metaphors and concepts to analyse social phenomena, examining how environmental factors influence social structures, community formation, and human adaptation. These approaches contribute to understanding urbanisation processes, environmental sustainability challenges, and the social dimensions of environmental change. The domain bridges sociology with environmental studies, geography, and urban planning, offering insights into how spatial organisation affects social life and how social processes create and modify physical environments. This interdisciplinary perspective is increasingly important for addressing contemporary challenges related to climate change, urbanisation, and sustainable development, providing analytical frameworks for understanding the social dimensions of environmental issues.</Literal>

Housing in squatter settlements is often self-built by the settlers themselves using whatever discarded or inexpensive materials they can find, resulting in makeshift structures that may lack basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, electricity, and secure tenure. These settlements often emerge due to rapid urbanisation, poverty, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate urban planning, and they can face challenges related to overcrowding, health risks, and the threat of eviction.

It typically includes governmental institutions such as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as the civil service officials who administer state functions. A key feature of the state is its claim to sovereignty over the territory and its citizens, meaning it asserts the ultimate authority within its borders, often recognised by other states in the international system. The state plays a crucial role in establishing and enforcing laws, providing public services, regulating the economy, and defending its territory and interests, often relying on a monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within its boundaries to ensure compliance and maintain social order.</Literal>

Membership in a status group is often based on shared attributes such as ethnicity, religion, occupation, education, or family background, which are socially valued or devalued and contribute to a sense of collective identity and social standing. Status groups are characterised by a shared style of life, which can include distinctive patterns of consumption, social interaction, and cultural practices.

A stigma can be attached to various conditions, behaviours, or identities, such as mental illness, criminal history, physical disabilities, certain lifestyles, or membership in particular social groups. The process of stigmatisation can lead to social exclusion, discrimination, prejudice, and a loss of social status for the stigmatised individuals or groups, often impacting their self-esteem, social interactions, and opportunities in life.

This hierarchical arrangement is based on various social categories such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, and other factors, leading to systematic inequalities in access to resources and opportunities. While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, stratification implies a more enduring and institutionalised pattern of inequality where certain groups consistently have more advantages and privileges than others.

They reflect the fundamental structure of inequality in modern societies and the ways in which economic positions become translated into broader patterns of social stratification. These class aggregates often develop distinct cultures, political orientations, and collective interests that shape broader social and political dynamics.

Structural functionalists examine how these institutions work together to meet the needs of society and maintain social equilibrium through shared norms, values, and consensus.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Structuration is a sociological theory, most prominently associated with the work of Anthony Giddens, that attempts to bridge the divide between agency (the actions of individuals) and social structure (the broader social forces and institutions that shape those actions). It posits that social structure and human agency are not separate or opposing forces but are mutually dependent and interactive in a two-way process. Individuals shape their social world through their everyday actions and practices, but these actions are also enabled and constrained by existing social structures, which in turn are reproduced and sometimes transformed through those very actions. Structuration emphasises the dynamic and recursive relationship between individual agency and social structure, highlighting how they continuously influence and reshape each other over time.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">A subculture is a segment of society that shares a distinctive pattern of mores (norms deemed highly necessary to the welfare of a society), folkways (norms governing everyday social behaviour), values, beliefs, and often behaviours that differ from the dominant patterns of the larger society to which it belongs. Members of a subculture typically identify with each other and may share common interests, lifestyles, or social characteristics that set them apart from the mainstream culture. Subcultures can emerge based on a variety of factors, including age, ethnicity, social class, religion, occupation, sexual orientation, or shared hobbies and interests, and they can manifest in distinct styles of dress, language (including argot or specialised language), music preferences, and social practices. While subcultures maintain their own unique characteristics, they are still part of and interact with the broader society, sometimes influencing it and sometimes being influenced by it. The study of subcultures helps sociologists understand the diversity within societies and the ways in which different groups navigate and express their identities within a larger cultural context.</Literal>

Metropolitan areas are typically defined as having at least one urbanised area of 50,000 or more people, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core urban area, as measured by commuting ties. Suburbs are often characterised by lower population density compared to central cities, a higher proportion of single-family homes, and a greater reliance on automobiles for transportation. They have become a significant form of residential and commercial development in many industrialised countries, often representing a migration of population and economic activity away from the central urban core. The development and characteristics of suburbs are influenced by various factors, including transportation infrastructure, housing policies, economic trends, and social preferences.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">In an economic and sociological context, Surplus primarily refers to an excess of production or resources beyond what is immediately needed or consumed. This category often relates to the concept of "surplus value" in Marxist theory, which describes the value of a worker's labor that is "left over" after the cost of their wages has been repaid to the employer, constituting the capitalist's profit and representing a form of exploitation. Beyond this specific Marxist usage, "surplus" can also describe any excess production (e.g., agricultural surplus allowing for specialisation and urbanisation) or resources accumulated by a society beyond its immediate subsistence needs. The generation and distribution of surplus are central to understanding economic systems, social stratification, and the development of more complex societies, as it allows for investment, the division of labor, and the emergence of non-productive classes.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">In Marxist economic theory, surplus value is the difference between the value of the goods or services produced by a worker's labor power and the wages the employer pays for that labor power; it is the value of the worker's labor that is 'left over' after the employer has covered all the costs involved in hiring the worker, including wages and the costs of production. According to Marx, this surplus value is the source of capitalist profit and represents the exploitation of the proletariat (working class) by the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) because the workers do not receive the full value of what they produce; instead, the surplus is appropriated by the capitalists who own the means of production. The extraction of surplus value is seen by Marx as a fundamental characteristic of capitalism and a key driver of the inherent conflict between the interests of capitalists and workers.</Literal>

The goal of a survey is to collect data on the attitudes, beliefs, behaviours, opinions, or characteristics of the population of interest through the responses provided by the sample members. The data collected through surveys is often analysed using statistical techniques to identify patterns, regularities, and relationships between variables within the population. Surveys can be conducted in various formats, including mail-in questionnaires, telephone interviews, face-to-face interviews, and online surveys, each with its own advantages and limitations in terms of cost, response rates, and the type of data that can be collected. The quality of a survey depends on factors such as the design of the questions, the selection of a representative sample, and the rate of response from the participants.</Literal>

This perspective views society as a product of everyday social interactions among individuals who communicate and interpret the world around them through shared symbols and meanings. Symbolic interactionists focus on how individuals create, negotiate, and modify meanings through their interactions, and how these meanings shape their behaviour and social reality.

They can represent abstract ideas, emotions, values, or concrete objects, and they are essential for communication, social interaction, and the creation and maintenance of culture.

Research has shown that when teachers hold high expectations for certain students, they may unconsciously treat those students in ways that encourage and facilitate their success, leading to improved performance that confirms the initial expectations. Conversely, low expectations can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where students perform poorly because their teachers do not believe in their ability to succeed and may provide less support or fewer opportunities.

This category includes fundamental analytical concepts like Pierre Bourdieu's cultural capital, which explains how knowledge, skills, and cultural resources translate into social advantages and reproduce inequality across generations. Max Weber's ideal type methodology provides a framework for constructing analytical models that highlight essential characteristics of social phenomena. Data analysis concepts encompass the statistical and interpretive tools necessary for making sense of empirical findings. Inequality concepts provide vocabulary for understanding social stratification and differential access to resources and opportunities. Interpretative sociology emphasises the subjective meanings and cultural understandings that shape social action. Semiotics offers tools for analysing symbols and signs in communication and cultural systems.

These countries, often located in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, were typically characterised by low levels of industrialisation, poverty, and dependence on agriculture or the extraction of raw materials. The majority of the world's population lived in Third World countries during this period. With the end of the Cold War and the increasing complexity of global economic and political landscapes, the term "Third World" has become less commonly used and is often considered problematic due to its overgeneralisation and implication of a hierarchical global order.

It is a hypothetical measure that provides an estimate of the average family size in a population based on current trends in fertility. A TFR of around 2.1 children per woman is generally considered the replacement level, which is the average number of children needed to replace the parents and maintain a stable population size in the long run, assuming no migration.

These institutions are characterised by a breakdown of the barriers separating the three spheres of life that are usually distinct: sleep, work, and play; all aspects of life are conducted in the same place and under the same single authority. Residents typically experience a loss of autonomy and personal identity as their daily routines are strictly controlled, and they are subjected to a uniform system of rules and regulations aimed at managing large groups of people within the confines of the institution. Goffman's analysis of total institutions highlighted the processes of resocialisation and the potential for the stripping away of former identities and the adoption of an institutional identity among residents.</Literal>

This practice can result in students being separated into different tracks, such as "high-achieving," "average," or "low-achieving," which may offer different levels of academic rigor, resources, and future opportunities. While proponents argue that tracking allows teachers to tailor instruction to the specific needs of students at different academic levels, critics raise concerns about its potential to perpetuate social inequalities, as students from disadvantaged backgrounds may be disproportionately placed in lower tracks, limiting their educational attainment and future prospects, while those in higher tracks often receive more enriched learning experiences and better preparation for college.

Trade unions operate through elected leadership and bargaining committees that negotiate with employers on behalf of their members in a process known as collective bargaining, aiming to establish labor contracts or collective bargaining agreements that outline the terms of employment. Unions may organise workers based on their specific skills (craft unionism), across various trades (general unionism), or within an entire industry (industrial unionism). Historically, trade unions emerged in response to the often precarious and exploitative conditions faced by workers, particularly during the Industrial Revolution, providing a collective voice and power to negotiate for fairer treatment and improved livelihoods. They have played a significant role in advocating for workers' rights, safer workplaces, and the end of child labor, often operating with a democratic structure where members elect officers and pay dues to support the union's activities.</Literal>

This type of authority is often associated with hereditary leadership, where the right to rule is inherited through family lineage and is accepted as legitimate because it has always been that way. Obedience is owed to the person in authority due to their traditional status and the sanctity of established customs, rather than based on their personal charisma or legally defined rules. Examples of traditional authority can be found in monarchies where power is passed down through royal families, or in traditional tribal societies where leadership is based on long-standing customs and norms. Weber contrasted traditional authority with charismatic authority, which is based on the exceptional personal appeal of a leader, and rational-legal authority, which is based on formally established rules and laws.</Literal>

The addition of a third member introduces new dynamics and possibilities for social interaction that are not present in a dyad. For example, in a triad, there is the potential for one member to act as a mediator or arbitrator in disputes between the other two, which is not possible in a dyad where conflict can only be resolved directly or lead to the dissolution of the group. A triad can also experience the formation of coalitions or alliances between two members, potentially leaving the third member isolated or in a minority position. The presence of three individuals can also diffuse intensity compared to a dyad, making the group potentially more stable as the loss of one member does not necessarily lead to the group's termination. The study of triads is important in sociology for understanding basic group dynamics and the emergence of social structures within small groups.</Literal>

While primarily a concept in psychology, the idea of the unconscious can have sociological relevance in understanding deeply ingrained social norms, cultural values, and hidden biases that may operate at a level below conscious awareness and shape social interactions, attitudes, and societal patterns. For example, unconscious biases related to race, gender, or social class can influence discriminatory behaviours even in individuals who consciously believe in equality.

This perspective suggests that the current state of poverty and limited economic development in many of these societies is not simply a natural or inevitable condition but is, in part, a result of historical processes of exploitation and dependence imposed by powerful, wealthy states, which actively extracted resources, disrupted local economies, and established unequal trade relationships that continue to disadvantage these nations.

This theory suggested that different societies were simply at different points along this universal evolutionary trajectory. Unilinear evolutionary theories have been widely criticised for their ethnocentric biases, their lack of empirical support, and their failure to account for the diversity of historical and cultural development across different societies, often imposing a Western-centric view of progress onto other cultures.

It typically involves a range of strategies, such as recycling underutilised land and existing buildings for new purposes, improving the physical environment through infrastructure upgrades and beautification projects, implementing better management practices for local areas with the active participation of local citizens, and strategically using public funds to stimulate regeneration and attract further private investment. The goals of urban renewal often include enhancing the quality of life for residents, fostering economic development, improving housing conditions, and creating more vibrant and sustainable urban communities. However, urban renewal projects can sometimes lead to unintended consequences such as gentrification and the displacement of existing low-income residents, making community engagement and equitable planning crucial aspects of the process.</Literal>

        <IRI>#Urbanisation</IRI>
        <Literal xml:lang="en">Urbanisation refers to the process of the development of towns and cities, typically involving the growth in the size and population of urban areas and the increasing concentration of people living and working in these areas. This process is often linked to economic development, industrialisation, and the migration of people from rural to urban areas in search of opportunities. Urbanisation leads to significant transformations in land use, infrastructure development, social organisation, and lifestyles, creating complex urban environments that serve as centers of economic, political, and cultural activity. The study of urbanisation examines its causes, patterns, and consequences for societies, including issues related to urban planning, housing, transportation, social inequality, and environmental sustainability.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Urbanisation Processes refers to the dynamic and multifaceted changes involved in the growth and development of cities and urban areas, typically marked by the increasing concentration of populations in urban settings and the transformation of rural landscapes into urban ones. This category encompasses the historical evolution of cities (e.g., from preindustrial cities to industrial and postindustrial cities), the spatial organisation of urban areas (e.g., concentric-zone theory, multiple-nuclei theory), and the social and environmental consequences of urban growth (e.g., urban ecology, urban renewal, gentrification, defended neighborhoods, squatter settlements, suburbanisation). It also includes the study of urbanism (distinctive characteristics of urban social life), the development of new urban sociological perspectives, and the challenges related to urban planning, infrastructure, and social inequalities within metropolitan areas and vast urban regions (e.g., megalopolis). Understanding these processes is crucial for analysing the complexities of urban life and the ongoing societal shifts driven by population concentration.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Urbanism is a term used by sociologist Louis Wirth to denote the distinctive characteristics of social life that emerge in urban settings, particularly in large, densely populated cities, such as a greater degree of impersonality, anonymity, social heterogeneity, and a more complex division of labor compared to rural areas. Wirth argued that the size, density, and heterogeneity of urban populations shape the nature of social interactions and the social psychology of city dwellers, often leading to more formal and instrumental relationships, increased social tolerance for diversity, and a greater sense of individual freedom alongside potential feelings of social isolation or alienation. The study of urbanism explores how these unique social patterns and experiences in cities differ from those in more rural or traditional communities.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Validity in research refers to the extent to which a measurement instrument, test, or research study accurately measures precisely what it is intended to measure, ensuring that the findings genuinely represent the phenomenon or concept being investigated. It addresses the question of whether the research is actually capturing the truth about what is being studied. Different types of validity are important in research, including internal validity (the extent to which the study establishes a trustworthy cause-and-effect relationship between variables), external validity (the extent to which the findings can be generalised to other populations, settings, or times), construct validity (the degree to which a measure assesses the theoretical construct it is supposed to measure), and content validity (the extent to which a measure adequately covers all aspects of the construct of interest). Ensuring validity is crucial for the credibility and meaningfulness of research findings.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Value neutrality, a concept emphasised by Max Weber, refers to the principle that sociologists, when interpreting data and conducting research, should strive for objectivity and avoid allowing their personal values, beliefs, or biases to unduly influence their analysis or conclusions. While Weber acknowledged that sociologists, like all individuals, have their own values, he argued that it is essential for researchers to maintain a stance of neutrality and impartiality during the scientific process of studying society, focusing on the empirical evidence and logical reasoning rather than personal preferences or moral judgments. This principle aims to enhance the rigor and credibility of sociological research by minimizing the potential for subjective biases to distort the understanding of social phenomena.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Values are culturally defined standards or principles that are widely shared by members of a society or group and serve as broad guidelines for social living, indicating what people assess as desirable, good, beautiful, right, or important. Values provide a moral compass for behaviour, influencing people's attitudes, choices, and actions across various aspects of life, and they often form the basis for social norms, which are more specific rules and expectations for behaviour. Values can vary significantly across different cultures and can change over time within a society, reflecting evolving beliefs and priorities. They play a crucial role in shaping social cohesion, cultural identity, and the overall character of a society, and they are often transmitted from one generation to the next through the process of socialisation.</Literal>

It is a dimension along which an object, individual, or group can be categorised or measured, allowing for specific comparisons to be made with others or across different points in time. Examples of variables in sociological research include income level (which can vary from person to person), age (which changes over time for an individual), educational attainment (which differs among individuals), or social class (which can vary across groups or societies). Researchers examine the relationships between different variables to understand social phenomena, test hypotheses, and develop sociological theories. Variables can be independent (the presumed cause) or dependent (the presumed effect) in a causal relationship.</Literal>

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Vertical mobility refers to the movement of an individual or a group up or down the hierarchy of positions within a society's social stratification system. This movement signifies a change in social class, status, or power relative to one's previous position or the position of one's family of origin. Upward mobility involves moving to a higher social stratum, often characterised by increased wealth, income, occupational prestige, or social status. Examples include obtaining a higher-paying job, achieving a higher level of education, or marrying into a wealthier family. Downward mobility, on the other hand, involves moving to a lower social stratum, which might occur due to job loss, business failure, or a decline in health or economic circumstances. Vertical mobility is a key aspect of social stratification and is often studied to understand the openness and fluidity of a society's social structure.</Literal>

Because of their potential losses, those with vested interests often actively resist or oppose changes that could disrupt the established order from which they benefit, using their influence and resources to preserve their advantages and maintain the current distribution of power and wealth within society. Understanding vested interests is crucial for analysing why certain social changes face resistance and for comprehending the dynamics of power and social conflict within a society.</Literal>

This category encompasses various aspects related to the victim's perspective and their interactions with the criminal justice system and society. It includes the study of victimisation surveys, which collect data directly from individuals about their experiences as victims of crime, regardless of whether the crime was reported to the police. It also delves into the concept of victimless crimes, where there is no direct complainant, and examines the social and psychological impacts of being a victim of crime or other forms of harm, such as hate crimes, domestic violence, or discrimination. The study of victimisation also considers victimology, which is the scientific study of victims, and explores patterns of victimisation, risk factors, and the role of victims in the criminal justice process and in society's response to crime and harm.</Literal>

These surveys typically involve administering questionnaires or conducting interviews with a representative sample of the population, asking them about whether they have been victims of specific types of crimes over a particular period. Victimisation surveys can provide a more comprehensive picture of the extent of crime in a society, including the "dark figure of crime" (crimes that are not reported to law enforcement), and can offer valuable insights into the characteristics of victims, offenders, and the circumstances surrounding criminal events. They complement official crime statistics reported by police and can be used to assess trends in crime rates and the impact of crime on individuals and communities.</Literal>

These crimes often involve behaviours that are considered morally objectionable or against the law, but the individuals involved participate voluntarily and do not typically see themselves as victims. Examples of activities often categorised as victimless crimes include prostitution, illegal gambling, recreational drug use, and consensual homosexual acts (in jurisdictions where they are illegal). The debate around the legal status and societal response to victimless crimes often involves considerations of individual autonomy, morality, public health, and the role of government in regulating private behaviour.</Literal>

These crimes can include offenses such as embezzlement, tax evasion, insider trading, securities fraud, corporate fraud, bribery, and environmental violations. Unlike street crimes that often involve physical violence or property damage, white-collar crimes typically involve financial manipulation and can result in significant economic losses to individuals, organisations, and society as a whole, as well as eroding public trust in institutions and markets.

Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.</Literal>

This theory posits that the world economy is not a collection of independent national economies but rather a single, integrated system characterised by a global division of labor and a hierarchical structure consisting of three main categories of countries: core countries, which are the wealthy, industrialised nations that dominate the global economy and control advanced technology and capital; semi-peripheral countries, which occupy an intermediate position, often supplying labor and raw materials to the core and serving as a buffer between the core and the periphery, with some level of industrialisation and potential for upward or downward mobility within the system; and peripheral countries, which have a marginal role in the world economy, often specializing in the production of raw materials and agricultural goods for the core, and are thus economically dependent on and often exploited by the core countries in unequal trading relationships.

This theory emphasises the historical development of a global capitalist economy and the ways in which the relationships between core, semi-peripheral, and peripheral countries are characterised by power imbalances and dependencies that perpetuate global inequalities. Wallerstein's approach highlights the interconnectedness of nations within this global system and how the dynamics of capitalism at a world scale shape the economic and social development of individual countries, arguing that the global system, rather than individual national factors alone, is the primary unit of analysis for understanding social change and inequality in the modern world.</Literal>

This can manifest in various ways, such as a preference for foreign brands, a belief that foreign cultures are more advanced or sophisticated, or a tendency to adopt customs and practices from other societies while disregarding or criticizing one's own. Xenocentrism is essentially the opposite of ethnocentrism, which is the belief in the superiority of one's own culture. The phenomenon of xenocentrism can be influenced by factors such as globalisation, media exposure to other cultures, and historical or social contexts where one's own society may have experienced periods of hardship or perceived lack of progress compared to others.</Literal>

In other words, the rate of natural increase (births minus deaths) is offset by the rate of net migration (immigrants minus emigrants), resulting in an overall population growth rate of zero. Achieving ZPG can have various implications for a society, such as a more balanced age structure and potentially reduced pressure on natural resources and the environment, but it can also present challenges related to an aging workforce and potential economic impacts.</Literal>

Causal relation: {Anomie, Collective_Behaviour} → influencesHistorically → {Deviance, Crime}

Semantical explanation of anomie_ID000001: 
Anomie is a sociological concept, primarily associated with Emile Durkheim, that describes a state of normlessness or social disorganisation within a society or a social group. It occurs when there is a breakdown or absence of clear moral guidelines, social norms, and shared values, leading to a sense of confusion, disorientation, and lack of social regulation among individuals. Durkheim argued that rapid social change, such as industrialisation or economic crises, can disrupt traditional social bonds and norms, thereby contributing to anomie. When individuals experience anomie, they may feel disconnected from society, lack a sense of purpose, and be unsure of what behaviours are expected or appropriate. This state can lead to various negative consequences, including increased rates of deviance, crime, despair, and suicide, as individuals struggle to find meaning and direction in a deregulated social environment. Robert Merton later expanded on the concept, applying it to the strain individuals feel when culturally prescribed goals are not attainable through legitimate means.

Causal relation: {Anomie, Collective_Behaviour} → influencesHistorically → {Deviance, Crime}

Semantical explanation of collective_Behaviour_ID000001: 
Collective behaviour encompasses activities of people and social groups that typically emerge spontaneously (such as crowds, riots, and so on) rather than arising from established processes of socialisation leading to conformity to social rules and norms. These behaviours often occur in response to a shared situation or stimulus and can involve large numbers of people acting in relatively unstructured ways. Examples of collective behaviour include panics, fads, rumors, social movements, and disasters. Sociologists study collective behaviour to understand the dynamics of group actions that are not governed by typical social structures or institutions. Factors such as anonymity, suggestibility, and the rapid spread of information can play a significant role in shaping collective behaviour.

Causal relation: {Anomie, Collective_Behaviour} → influencesHistorically → {Deviance, Crime}

Semantical explanation of deviance_ID000001: 
Deviance refers to behaviour that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society. What is considered deviant varies across cultures, social groups, and time periods, as it is defined by social norms and values. Deviant behaviour can range from minor infractions of social norms to serious violations of laws. Sociologists study deviance to understand why people violate norms, how societies react to deviance, and the role of deviance in social change. Various theories attempt to explain deviance, including anomie theory, differential association theory, control theory, and labeling theory. Deviance is not inherently negative; while some deviant acts are harmful, others can challenge existing norms and lead to social progress.

Semantical explanation of crime_ID000001: 
Crime is a violation of criminal law for which formal penalties are applied by some governmental authority. What constitutes a crime is defined by legal statutes at the local, state, or federal level, and these definitions can vary across jurisdictions and change over time. Crimes are typically classified based on their severity, ranging from minor offenses (misdemeanors) to serious felonies. The criminal justice system, including law enforcement agencies, courts, and correctional institutions, is responsible for enforcing criminal laws, apprehending offenders, and administering penalties, which can include fines, probation, imprisonment, or, in some cases, capital punishment. Sociologists study crime from various perspectives, examining its social causes, patterns, and consequences, as well as the functioning of the criminal justice system and its impact on society.

Causal relation: {Anticipatory_Socialisation, Role_Taking} → socialises → {Status, Identity}

Semantical explanation of anticipatory_Socialisation_ID000001: 
Anticipatory socialisation refers to the processes of socialisation in which a person "rehearses" for future positions, occupations, and social relationships. This involves learning the norms, values, and behaviours associated with a status or role that the individual expects to occupy in the future. By engaging in anticipatory socialisation, individuals can prepare themselves for the challenges and expectations of new roles, making the transition smoother when they eventually occupy those positions. Examples include teenagers who start dressing or behaving in ways they associate with adulthood, or students who take on internships to learn about a future profession. This process can help individuals develop the necessary skills and understanding to navigate new social environments and fulfill the requirements of future roles effectively. It plays a crucial role in facilitating social mobility and adaptation to changing life circumstances.

Causal relation: {Anticipatory_Socialisation, Role_Taking} → socialises → {Status, Identity}

Semantical explanation of role_Taking_ID000001: 
Role taking is a fundamental social psychological process, particularly emphasised in the symbolic interactionist perspective, that involves mentally assuming the perspective, attitudes, feelings, and expectations of another individual or a group, thereby enabling one to understand how they might think, feel, and respond in a particular situation and to adjust one's own behaviour accordingly. This ability to take the role of the other is crucial for effective communication, social interaction, empathy, and the development of a sense of self, as it allows individuals to anticipate others' reactions and to see themselves from an external viewpoint. George Herbert Mead highlighted the importance of role taking in the development of the self, suggesting that through taking on the roles of significant others and the generalised other, individuals develop a sense of social self and learn to navigate social situations.

Causal relation: {Anticipatory_Socialisation, Role_Taking} → socialises → {Status, Identity}

Semantical explanation of status_ID000001: 
Status, in sociological terms, refers to any of the full range of socially defined positions that an individual can occupy within a large group or society. Statuses provide a framework for social organisation and interaction, as they come with associated roles, expectations, rights, and obligations that guide how individuals are expected to behave in different social contexts. As mentioned previously, statuses can be either ascribed, assigned to an individual at birth or involuntarily, or achieved, attained through personal effort or choice. An individual typically holds multiple statuses simultaneously, forming their status set, and one status may become more significant than others in shaping their social identity and interactions; this is known as a master status.

Causal relation: {Anticipatory_Socialisation, Role_Taking} → socialises → {Status, Identity}

Semantical explanation of identity_ID000001: 
Identity refers to the distinctive characteristics of a person's character or the character of a group which relate to who they are and what is meaningful to them, providing a sense of self and belonging. Some of the main sources of identity include gender, encompassing social expectations of masculinity and femininity; sexual orientation, referring to patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction; nationality or ethnicity, based on shared cultural heritage, origin, and often language or religion; and social class, reflecting one's position in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Identity is not fixed but is fluid and can evolve over an individual's life course through interactions with others and within different social contexts. It shapes how individuals perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others, influencing their social interactions, opportunities, and experiences within society.

Causal relation: {Apartheid, Racism} → segregates → {Racial_Group, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of apartheid_ID000001: 
Apartheid was the former policy of the South African government designed to maintain the separation of Blacks and other non-Whites from the dominant Whites. This system of racial segregation and discrimination was implemented through legislation that classified people into racial groups and enforced their separation in all aspects of life, including housing, education, employment, healthcare, and political participation. The apartheid regime systematically privileged the White minority and subjected the Black majority to severe oppression and denial of basic human rights. This policy was in effect from 1948 to 1994 and drew widespread international condemnation, leading to various sanctions and boycotts against South Africa. The dismantling of apartheid began in the early 1990s with the release of Nelson Mandela and the subsequent reforms that led to multiracial elections and the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa. The legacy of apartheid continues to impact South African society, with ongoing efforts to address the deep-seated inequalities and social divisions created by this discriminatory system.

Causal relation: {Apartheid, Racism} → segregates → {Racial_Group, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of racism_ID000001: 
Racism is the attribution of characteristics of superiority or inferiority to a population sharing certain physically inherited characteristics, often leading to prejudice, discrimination, and the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over others. It is a complex system of power and ideology that operates at individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels, based on the social construction of racial categories and the belief that these categories are biologically real and associated with distinct traits, abilities, or moral character. Racism can manifest as overt acts of discrimination and hate speech, as well as in more subtle forms of bias embedded in social structures, policies, and practices that perpetuate racial inequalities in areas such as education, employment, housing, and the criminal justice system. It is a pervasive and harmful social phenomenon with deep historical roots and lasting consequences for individuals and societies.

Causal relation: {Apartheid, Racism} → segregates → {Racial_Group, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of racial_Group_ID000001: 
A racial group is a category of people who are set apart from others within a society primarily because of obvious physical differences that are perceived as socially significant and are used to define group membership and often to justify differential treatment and social hierarchies. These perceived physical differences are not inherently meaningful but become socially significant when a society defines them as such and uses them as a basis for categorizing people and assigning them to different social positions, often leading to inequalities in power, privilege, and status. The concept of racial groups is closely tied to the social construction of race and the social processes of racialisation, where certain physical characteristics are imbued with social meaning and used to create racial categories that have real social consequences.

Causal relation: {Apartheid, Racism} → segregates → {Racial_Group, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of social_Exclusion_ID000001: 
Social exclusion is a complex and multidimensional process and outcome where individuals or groups are prevented from fully participating in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of the society in which they are located due to a combination of multiple and often intersecting deprivations. These deprivations can include lack of adequate income and resources, limited access to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and social support networks, as well as experiences of discrimination, marginalisation, and a lack of voice or power in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Social exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and a diminished sense of belonging, hindering individuals' ability to exercise their rights, fulfill their potential, and participate as full and valued members of society. Addressing social exclusion requires tackling the various interconnected factors that contribute to it through inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and social integration for all members of society.

Causal relation: {Authority, Legitimacy} → legitimises → {Power, Values}

Semantical explanation of authority_ID000001: 
Authority is power that has been institutionalised and is recognised by the people over whom it is exercised. It is a form of legitimate power, meaning that those subject to it accept its rightfulness. Sociologist Max Weber identified three main types of authority: traditional authority, charismatic authority, and rational-legal authority. Traditional authority is based on long-established customs and traditions, often associated with hereditary leadership. Charismatic authority stems from the exceptional personal qualities or appeal of a leader, inspiring devotion and obedience. Rational-legal authority is based on formal rules, laws, and procedures, typically associated with bureaucratic systems and elected officials. The recognition and acceptance of authority are crucial for maintaining social order and stability within a society. When power is perceived as legitimate authority, it is more likely to be obeyed and less likely to be challenged.

Causal relation: {Authority, Legitimacy} → legitimises → {Power, Values}

Semantical explanation of legitimacy_ID000001: 
Legitimacy in a political context refers to the widespread acceptance by the people governed that a particular political order, regime, or authority is just, right, and valid, and therefore deserving of their obedience and support. When a political system is seen as legitimate, people are more likely to comply with its laws and decisions voluntarily, leading to greater stability and social order. Legitimacy can be based on various factors, including tradition, charisma of leaders, and adherence to legal-rational principles and democratic processes. The perception of legitimacy is crucial for the effective exercise of power, as it reduces the need for coercion and fosters cooperation between the government and the governed.

Causal relation: {Authority, Legitimacy} → legitimises → {Power, Values}

Semantical explanation of power_ID000001: 
Power, in its most fundamental sociological sense, is the ability of an individual or group to exercise their will over others, even in the face of resistance, and to bring about desired outcomes or to prevent undesired ones. Power can manifest in various forms, including political power, economic power, social power, and cultural power, and it can be based on different sources such as authority, force, influence, or control over resources. The study of power is central to sociology, as it underlies social inequalities, shapes social interactions, and drives social change. Sociologists analyse how power is distributed, how it is used and contested, and its impact on individuals, groups, and social structures.

Semantical explanation of values_ID000001: 
Values are culturally defined standards or principles that are widely shared by members of a society or group and serve as broad guidelines for social living, indicating what people assess as desirable, good, beautiful, right, or important. Values provide a moral compass for behaviour, influencing people's attitudes, choices, and actions across various aspects of life, and they often form the basis for social norms, which are more specific rules and expectations for behaviour. Values can vary significantly across different cultures and can change over time within a society, reflecting evolving beliefs and priorities. They play a crucial role in shaping social cohesion, cultural identity, and the overall character of a society, and they are often transmitted from one generation to the next through the process of socialisation.

Semantical explanation of legal-rational_Authority_ID000001: 
Legal-rational authority, as defined by Max Weber, is a type of power made legitimate by law, rules, and regulations that are rationally established and applied impartially. This form of authority is characteristic of modern bureaucratic organisations and states, where power is vested in positions or offices rather than in individuals based on tradition or personal charisma. Obedience is owed to the legally established rules and to those who hold positions of authority within that framework only when they are acting within the scope of those rules. Legal-rational authority emphasises competence, expertise, and adherence to formal procedures, contributing to efficiency and predictability in governance and organisational management. It is a cornerstone of modern democratic societies and bureaucratic structures.

Causal relation: {Legal-rational_Authority, Traditional_Authority} → regulates → {Legitimacy, Power}

Semantical explanation of traditional_Authority_ID000001: 
Traditional authority, as defined by Max Weber, is a form of legitimate power that is conferred by custom, established traditions, and accepted practices that have been passed down over time. This type of authority is often associated with hereditary leadership, where the right to rule is inherited through family lineage and is accepted as legitimate because it has always been that way. Obedience is owed to the person in authority due to their traditional status and the sanctity of established customs, rather than based on their personal charisma or legally defined rules. Examples of traditional authority can be found in monarchies where power is passed down through royal families, or in traditional tribal societies where leadership is based on long-standing customs and norms. Weber contrasted traditional authority with charismatic authority, which is based on the exceptional personal appeal of a leader, and rational-legal authority, which is based on formally established rules and laws.

Semantical explanation of innovation_ID000001: 
Innovation is the process of introducing new elements, ideas, methods, or products into a culture or society, leading to change and often improvement. This can occur through two primary mechanisms: discovery and invention. Discovery involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown or unrecognised, such as a new scientific fact or a previously unknown natural resource. Invention, on the other hand, involves creating something entirely new that did not exist before, such as a new technology, a new tool, or a new process. Both discovery and invention can have profound impacts on a culture, leading to new practices, beliefs, social structures, and material advancements. The rate and nature of innovation can vary significantly across different societies and historical periods, influenced by factors such as technological development, cultural values, and social organisation.

Semantical explanation of internet_ID000001: 
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that allows people to communicate with one another and find information on the Worldwide Web by exchanging data in various forms, including visuals, sounds, and text. This vast network operates in a way that largely transcends the limitations of time, physical space, and the traditional costs and control mechanisms associated with distance and territorial governments.

Semantical explanation of economy_ID000001: 
The economy refers to the system of production and exchange which provides for the material needs of individuals living in a given society. It encompasses all activities related to the creation, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The economy is a fundamental aspect of social life, as it shapes how people earn a living, access resources, and interact with one another in the process of fulfilling their material needs and wants. The structure and functioning of the economy are influenced by a complex interplay of social, cultural, political, and technological factors. Sociologists study the economy to understand its impact on social inequality, social mobility, work, and other aspects of social life. Different types of economies, such as agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial economies, have distinct characteristics and social consequences.

Causal relation: {Innovation, Internet} → automates → {Economy, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000001: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Semantical explanation of biographical_Research_ID000001: 
Biographical research is a qualitative research approach that takes individual lives or life histories as its main focus of interest. It seeks to understand the social world through the detailed examination of personal experiences and the stories people tell about their lives. This type of research often involves in-depth interviews, analysis of personal documents (such as letters or diaries), and sometimes ethnographic observations to gain a rich and holistic understanding of the individual's life within their social context. Biographical research can provide valuable insights into social processes, cultural norms, and the ways individuals shape and are shaped by their social environments. It is used in various social science disciplines, including sociology, psychology, and anthropology, to explore topics such as identity formation, social change, and the impact of historical events on personal lives.

Causal relation: {Biographical_Research, Life_Histories} → interviews → {Interview, Oral_History}

Semantical explanation of life_Histories_ID000001: 
Life histories are in-depth studies of the overall lives of individuals, often using a qualitative research approach that gathers detailed information about a person's experiences, perspectives, and the significant events that have shaped their life course. These studies often rely on a combination of data sources, including self-reporting through interviews, personal narratives, and autobiographies, as well as documentary evidence such as letters, diaries, photographs, and official records. The goal of life history research is to understand the individual's life within its broader social, cultural, and historical context, exploring how personal experiences intersect with larger social forces and patterns. This method can provide rich insights into topics such as identity formation, social change, the impact of historical events on individuals, and the subjective meanings people attach to their lives.

Causal relation: {Biographical_Research, Life_Histories} → interviews → {Interview, Oral_History}

Semantical explanation of interview_ID000001: 
In sociological research, an interview is a method of data collection that involves a series of questions a researcher administers personally to respondents, either face-to-face, by telephone, or through video conferencing. Interviews can be structured, following a predetermined set of questions in a specific order, or unstructured, allowing for more open-ended conversation and exploration of topics. Semi-structured interviews combine elements of both approaches, using an interview guide with key questions but allowing for flexibility in probing responses and exploring related issues that may arise. Interviews are a valuable tool for gathering in-depth qualitative data about individuals' experiences, perspectives, attitudes, and beliefs, providing rich insights into social phenomena that may not be captured by quantitative methods like surveys. The success of an interview depends on the researcher's ability to establish rapport with the respondent, ask clear and unbiased questions, and actively listen to and record their responses accurately.

Semantical explanation of oral_History_ID000001: 
Oral history refers to a method of collecting historical information and personal narratives through interviews with people about events they witnessed or experienced earlier in their lives. These interviews are typically recorded and transcribed, providing valuable primary source material that can offer unique perspectives and details not found in written documents. Oral history is widely used in sociology, history, anthropology, and other social sciences to understand past events, social changes, and the lived experiences of individuals and communities from their own viewpoints. It can capture the nuances of personal memories, emotions, and interpretations, enriching our understanding of the past and contributing to a more diverse and inclusive historical record.

Causal relation: {Bureaucracy} → coordinates → {Rationalisation}

Semantical explanation of bureaucracy_ID000001: 
Bureaucracy is an organisation of a hierarchical sort, which takes the form of a pyramid of authority, with clear lines of command and responsibility. The term 'bureaucracy' was popularised by Max Weber, who considered it the most efficient type of large-scale human organisation in modern society. According to Weber, bureaucracy is characterised by a division of labor, a clearly defined hierarchy, formal rules and regulations, impersonality, and a focus on technical competence. As organisations grow in size and complexity, Weber argued, they inevitably tend to become more and more bureaucratised to manage their operations effectively.

Causal relation: {Bureaucracy} → coordinates → {Rationalisation}

Semantical explanation of rationalisation_ID000001: 
Rationalisation is a concept extensively used by Max Weber to refer to the multifaceted process by which modes of precise calculation, efficiency-oriented organisation, and action based on abstract rules, laws, and procedures increasingly come to dominate the social world, replacing more traditional, emotional, or value-driven forms of social organisation and behaviour. This process is a central theme in Weber's analysis of modernity and is closely linked to the rise of bureaucracy, capitalism, and science. Rationalisation involves a shift towards systematic thinking, the application of reason and logic to social life, and an emphasis on predictability and control through formal structures and procedures. While it has led to advancements in technology, efficiency, and administration, Weber also cautioned about the potential negative consequences of rationalisation, such as the disenchantment of the world and the dominance of impersonal bureaucratic structures.

Semantical explanation of bureaucratisation_ID000001: 
Bureaucratisation is the process by which a group, organisation, or social movement becomes increasingly bureaucratic in its structure and operation. This involves the adoption of the characteristics of a bureaucracy, such as hierarchical organisation, formal rules and procedures, specialisation of tasks, and impersonal relationships. Bureaucratisation often occurs as organisations grow and seek greater efficiency and standardisation in their activities. While it can lead to increased efficiency, it can also result in rigidity, red tape, and a decrease in flexibility and personal initiative.

Causal relation: {Bureaucratisation, Legal-rational_Authority} → institutionalises → {Formal_Organisation, Law}

Semantical explanation of legal-rational_Authority_ID000002: 
Legal-rational authority, as defined by Max Weber, is a type of power made legitimate by law, rules, and regulations that are rationally established and applied impartially. This form of authority is characteristic of modern bureaucratic organisations and states, where power is vested in positions or offices rather than in individuals based on tradition or personal charisma. Obedience is owed to the legally established rules and to those who hold positions of authority within that framework only when they are acting within the scope of those rules. Legal-rational authority emphasises competence, expertise, and adherence to formal procedures, contributing to efficiency and predictability in governance and organisational management. It is a cornerstone of modern democratic societies and bureaucratic structures.

Causal relation: {Bureaucratisation, Legal-rational_Authority} → institutionalises → {Formal_Organisation, Law}

Semantical explanation of formal_Organisation_ID000001: 
A formal organisation is a special-purpose group designed and structured for maximum efficiency in achieving specific goals or objectives. These organisations are characterised by a hierarchical structure of authority, a clear division of labor based on specialised roles and responsibilities, formal rules and procedures governing operations, and impersonal relationships among members. Examples of formal organisations include corporations, government agencies, universities, and hospitals. Max Weber's concept of bureaucracy is a classic example of a formal organisation designed for rational and efficient goal attainment. The formal structure of these organisations aims to ensure coordination, accountability, and predictability in their operations, although it can sometimes lead to rigidity and a lack of flexibility.

Semantical explanation of law_ID000001: 
Law refers to governmental social control, representing a formal system of rules and regulations enacted and enforced by political authorities to govern behaviour and maintain social order within a society. Laws are typically written down and specify both the behaviours that are prohibited or required and the sanctions or penalties that will be applied when violations occur. The legal system includes various institutions, such as legislatures that create laws, law enforcement agencies that enforce them, and courts that interpret laws and adjudicate disputes. Law plays a crucial role in establishing norms, resolving conflicts, protecting rights, and providing a framework for social interaction in complex societies. The legitimacy and effectiveness of law depend on its acceptance by the people it governs and its consistent and fair application.

Causal relation: {Bureaucratisation, Rationalisation} → bureaucratises → {Bureaucracy, Formal_Organisation}

Semantical explanation of bureaucratisation_ID000002: 
Bureaucratisation is the process by which a group, organisation, or social movement becomes increasingly bureaucratic in its structure and operation. This involves the adoption of the characteristics of a bureaucracy, such as hierarchical organisation, formal rules and procedures, specialisation of tasks, and impersonal relationships. Bureaucratisation often occurs as organisations grow and seek greater efficiency and standardisation in their activities. While it can lead to increased efficiency, it can also result in rigidity, red tape, and a decrease in flexibility and personal initiative.

Causal relation: {Bureaucratisation, Rationalisation} → bureaucratises → {Bureaucracy, Formal_Organisation}

Semantical explanation of rationalisation_ID000002: 
Rationalisation is a concept extensively used by Max Weber to refer to the multifaceted process by which modes of precise calculation, efficiency-oriented organisation, and action based on abstract rules, laws, and procedures increasingly come to dominate the social world, replacing more traditional, emotional, or value-driven forms of social organisation and behaviour. This process is a central theme in Weber's analysis of modernity and is closely linked to the rise of bureaucracy, capitalism, and science. Rationalisation involves a shift towards systematic thinking, the application of reason and logic to social life, and an emphasis on predictability and control through formal structures and procedures. While it has led to advancements in technology, efficiency, and administration, Weber also cautioned about the potential negative consequences of rationalisation, such as the disenchantment of the world and the dominance of impersonal bureaucratic structures.

Causal relation: {Bureaucratisation, Rationalisation} → bureaucratises → {Bureaucracy, Formal_Organisation}

Semantical explanation of bureaucracy_ID000002: 
Bureaucracy is an organisation of a hierarchical sort, which takes the form of a pyramid of authority, with clear lines of command and responsibility. The term 'bureaucracy' was popularised by Max Weber, who considered it the most efficient type of large-scale human organisation in modern society. According to Weber, bureaucracy is characterised by a division of labor, a clearly defined hierarchy, formal rules and regulations, impersonality, and a focus on technical competence. As organisations grow in size and complexity, Weber argued, they inevitably tend to become more and more bureaucratised to manage their operations effectively.

Semantical explanation of formal_Organisation_ID000002: 
A formal organisation is a special-purpose group designed and structured for maximum efficiency in achieving specific goals or objectives. These organisations are characterised by a hierarchical structure of authority, a clear division of labor based on specialised roles and responsibilities, formal rules and procedures governing operations, and impersonal relationships among members. Examples of formal organisations include corporations, government agencies, universities, and hospitals. Max Weber's concept of bureaucracy is a classic example of a formal organisation designed for rational and efficient goal attainment. The formal structure of these organisations aims to ensure coordination, accountability, and predictability in their operations, although it can sometimes lead to rigidity and a lack of flexibility.

Causal relation: {Bureaucracy, Rationalisation} → bureaucratises → {Alienation, Formal_Organisation}

Semantical explanation of alienation_ID000001: 
Alienation is the condition of being estranged or disassociated from the surrounding society. It involves a feeling of separation from one's milieu, work, the products of work, or self. The sense that our own abilities, as human beings, are taken over by other entities is also a key aspect. Sociologists like Marx described alienation in capitalist labor, where workers feel disconnected from their labor and its products. Durkheim focused on anomie, a state of normlessness leading to social alienation. Common variations of alienation include powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, cultural estrangement, social isolation, and self-estrangement. Alienation is a recurring theme in sociological analysis of modern life and is often depicted in literature and popular culture as psychological isolation.

Semantical explanation of capitalism_ID000001: 
Capitalism is a system of economic enterprise based on market exchange, private ownership of the means of production, and the pursuit of profit. 'Capital' refers to any asset, including money, property, and machines, which can be used to produce commodities for sale or invested in a market with the hope of achieving a profit. Key features of capitalism include free markets, competition, wage labor, and the accumulation of capital. While it can drive innovation and economic growth, capitalism has also been criticised for its potential to create social inequalities and economic instability. Karl Marx argued that capitalism leads to alienation of workers from their labor and the products they produce.

Semantical explanation of proletariat_ID000001: 
Proletariat, in the theoretical framework of Karl Marx, refers to the working class in a capitalist society who do not own the means of production (such as factories, land, and capital) and must therefore sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class who own the means of production) in order to earn a living and survive. According to Marx, the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie, who extract surplus value from their labor in the form of profit, leading to inherent class conflict and the potential for the proletariat to develop class consciousness and ultimately overthrow the capitalist system.

Semantical explanation of capitalism_ID000002: 
Capitalism is a system of economic enterprise based on market exchange, private ownership of the means of production, and the pursuit of profit. 'Capital' refers to any asset, including money, property, and machines, which can be used to produce commodities for sale or invested in a market with the hope of achieving a profit. Key features of capitalism include free markets, competition, wage labor, and the accumulation of capital. While it can drive innovation and economic growth, capitalism has also been criticised for its potential to create social inequalities and economic instability. Karl Marx argued that capitalism leads to alienation of workers from their labor and the products they produce.

Causal relation: {Capitalism} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of social_Stratification_ID000001: 
Social stratification refers to the existence of structured inequalities between different groups in society in terms of their access to material or symbolic rewards, such as wealth, income, prestige, power, status, and opportunities. While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, significant and enduring patterns of inequality, leading to hierarchical arrangements of social groups, tend to arise with the development of more complex, state-based systems. The most distinctive and extensively studied form of stratification in modern societies involves class divisions, based primarily on economic factors, but stratification can also occur along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and other social categories. Sociologists examine the causes and consequences of social stratification, as well as the processes that maintain or challenge these inequalities over time.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Mass_Production} → exploits → {Working_Class, Proletariat}

Semantical explanation of mass_Production_ID000001: 
Mass production is a system of manufacturing that involves the production of large quantities of standardised goods using machine power, specialised labor performing repetitive tasks, and often an assembly-line process. This method of production was a key outcome of the Industrial Revolution, particularly associated with the Fordist era of the early to mid-20th century, and it led to significant increases in efficiency and the availability of affordable consumer goods. Mass production relies on a high degree of division of labor and the use of interchangeable parts to streamline the manufacturing process. While it has been instrumental in driving economic growth and raising living standards, it has also been criticised for its potential to create monotonous and alienating work for employees and for its lack of flexibility in responding to diverse consumer demands. More recent trends in manufacturing include flexible production, which allows for greater customisation and variety.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Mass_Production} → exploits → {Working_Class, Proletariat}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000002: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Semantical explanation of proletariat_ID000002: 
Proletariat, in the theoretical framework of Karl Marx, refers to the working class in a capitalist society who do not own the means of production (such as factories, land, and capital) and must therefore sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class who own the means of production) in order to earn a living and survive. According to Marx, the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie, who extract surplus value from their labor in the form of profit, leading to inherent class conflict and the potential for the proletariat to develop class consciousness and ultimately overthrow the capitalist system.

Semantical explanation of industrialism_ID000001: 
Industrialism refers to a social and economic system characterised by the extensive use of technology, particularly sophisticated machinery powered by advanced sources of energy such as fossil fuels and electricity, to produce goods and services on a large scale. It is the driving force behind industrial societies, leading to mass production, specialisation of labor, and the growth of factories and urban centers. Industrialism has transformed the way people live and work, leading to unprecedented levels of material wealth and technological progress in many parts of the world. However, it has also brought about social changes, such as the rise of new social classes and new forms of social inequality, as well as environmental challenges related to resource consumption and pollution. The study of industrialism examines its historical development, its social and economic consequences, and its ongoing evolution in the face of new technological innovations and global challenges.

Bourgeoisie, in the theory of Karl Marx, refers to the capitalist class, comprising the owners of the means of production, such as factories, land, and capital. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie stands in opposition to the proletariat, or working class, who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie in order to survive.[1, 2] According to Marx, the bourgeoisie's primary goal is the accumulation of capital and profit, which they achieve through the exploitation of the proletariat. This class structure and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are central to Marx's critique of capitalism.

Semantical explanation of social_Inequality_ID000001: 
Social inequality refers to a condition within a society in which its members have significantly different amounts of wealth, income, prestige, power, or other valued resources and opportunities. This unequal distribution can be based on various social categories such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability, often resulting in hierarchical arrangements where some groups have more access to resources and privileges than others. Social inequality is a fundamental topic of study in sociology, with researchers examining its causes, consequences, and the ways in which it is maintained and challenged over time. It can manifest in various forms, including economic disparities, differences in social status and respect, and unequal access to political influence and decision-making power.

Semantical explanation of capitalism_ID000005: 
Capitalism is a system of economic enterprise based on market exchange, private ownership of the means of production, and the pursuit of profit. 'Capital' refers to any asset, including money, property, and machines, which can be used to produce commodities for sale or invested in a market with the hope of achieving a profit. Key features of capitalism include free markets, competition, wage labor, and the accumulation of capital. While it can drive innovation and economic growth, capitalism has also been criticised for its potential to create social inequalities and economic instability. Karl Marx argued that capitalism leads to alienation of workers from their labor and the products they produce.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Means_Of_Production} → economicallyRelatedTo → {Working_Class, Bourgeoisie}

Semantical explanation of means_Of_Production_ID000001: 
The means of production, a core concept in Marxist theory, refers to the resources, tools, technologies, land, factories, and other infrastructure whereby the production of material goods is carried on in a society. This concept encompasses not just the physical technology involved in production but also the social relations between the producers (e.g., the relationship between the owners of the means of production and the workers who use them). According to Marx, the ownership and control of the means of production are central to understanding the structure of society and the distribution of power and wealth. In capitalist societies, the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) owns and controls the means of production, while the proletariat (working class) must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie to survive, leading to inherent inequalities and class conflict.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Means_Of_Production} → economicallyRelatedTo → {Working_Class, Bourgeoisie}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000004: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Semantical explanation of bourgeoisie_ID000002: 
Bourgeoisie, in the theory of Karl Marx, refers to the capitalist class, comprising the owners of the means of production, such as factories, land, and capital. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie stands in opposition to the proletariat, or working class, who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie in order to survive.[1, 2] According to Marx, the bourgeoisie's primary goal is the accumulation of capital and profit, which they achieve through the exploitation of the proletariat. This class structure and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are central to Marx's critique of capitalism.

Causal relation: {Affirmative_Action, Political_Action_Committee_(PAC)} → advocates → {Minority_Group, Social_Movement}

Semantical explanation of affirmative_Action_ID000001: 
Affirmative action refers to actions favouring those who tend to suffer from discrimination, representing positive efforts to recruit minority group members or women for jobs, promotions, and educational opportunities. It aims to increase the representation of groups historically excluded from areas like employment and education. Unlike equal opportunity, which is passive, affirmative action is proactive, involving measures to avert discrimination. Policies may include preferential selection and monitoring workforce composition. Originating in the 1960s, affirmative action seeks to remedy past and present discrimination and promote diversity. However, it has faced debate, with opponents arguing it constitutes reverse discrimination, while proponents emphasise its necessity for addressing ongoing inequalities and fostering inclusion. The legal landscape surrounding affirmative action is complex and has evolved over time.

Causal relation: {Affirmative_Action, Political_Action_Committee_(PAC)} → advocates → {Minority_Group, Social_Movement}

Semantical explanation of political_Action_Committee_(PAC)_ID000001: 
A political action committee (PAC) is a political committee that is typically established by an interest groupâ€”such as a national bank, corporation, trade association, cooperative, or membership associationâ€”for the specific purpose of soliciting and distributing financial contributions to candidates running for political office or to political parties. PACs are a significant part of the campaign finance system in many democracies, allowing organised groups to pool resources and support candidates who align with their interests and policy objectives. The regulations governing PACs, including the amount of money they can raise and contribute, vary depending on the jurisdiction.

Causal relation: {Affirmative_Action, Political_Action_Committee_(PAC)} → advocates → {Minority_Group, Social_Movement}

Semantical explanation of minority_Group_ID000001: 
A minority group is a group of people in a minority in a given society who, because of their distinct physical or cultural characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability, find themselves in situations of inequality or disadvantage within that society. Membership in a minority group is typically ascribed rather than achieved, and these groups often experience discrimination, prejudice, and limited access to power and resources compared to the dominant or majority group. The term "minority" in this sociological context does not necessarily refer to a group's numerical size but rather to its subordinate status and lack of social, economic, and political power. Minority groups often develop a strong sense of group solidarity and shared identity in response to their experiences of marginalisation.

Causal relation: {Affirmative_Action, Political_Action_Committee_(PAC)} → advocates → {Minority_Group, Social_Movement}

Semantical explanation of social_Movement_ID000001: 
A social movement encompasses collective attempts by a group of people to further a common interest or secure a shared goal through organised action that typically takes place outside the sphere of established political institutions and conventional channels. These movements often arise in response to perceived social, economic, or political grievances and seek to bring about or resist social change, existing in a dynamic relationship, often one of conflict, with organisations or power structures whose objectives and outlook they frequently oppose. Social movements can vary widely in their goals, tactics, organisational structures, and the scale of change they aim to achieve, ranging from advocating for specific policy reforms to seeking fundamental transformations in societal norms and values. While they operate outside of formal political systems, successful social movements can sometimes influence policy and, if they manage to gain significant power and become institutionalised, may evolve into formal organisations or even political parties.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, Labour_Unions} → protests → {Politics, Social_Change}

Semantical explanation of labour_Unions_ID000001: 
Labour unions are formal organisations of workers who come together to collectively seek to improve their wages, working conditions, benefits, and job security through various strategies, including negotiation with employers (collective bargaining) and the use of tactics such as strikes when necessary. Unions provide a collective voice for workers, aiming to balance the power dynamic between individual employees and employers. They advocate for workers' rights, fair treatment, and safer workplaces. The history and influence of labour unions have played a significant role in shaping labor laws, workplace standards, and the overall distribution of economic power in many countries.

Semantical explanation of politics_ID000001: 
Politics, in Harold D. Lasswell's classic definition, is fundamentally about "who gets what, when, and how," highlighting the struggle for power and resources within a society and the processes through which decisions are made about their distribution and allocation. It involves the exercise of power and influence to shape policies, make collective decisions, and resolve conflicts over competing interests and values. Politics operates at various levels, from interpersonal relationships and small groups to national and international arenas, and is a central aspect of social organisation and governance.

Semantical explanation of social_Change_ID000001: 
Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Causal relation: {Colonialism, Neo-colonialism} → exploits → {Exploitation_Theory, Underdevelopment}

Semantical explanation of colonialism_ID000001: 
Colonialism is the maintenance of political, social, economic, and cultural dominance over a people by a foreign power for an extended period of time. This often involves the establishment of settlements and the exploitation of resources in the colonised territory for the benefit of the colonizing power. Colonialism has had a profound and lasting impact on the political, economic, and social structures of many regions around the world, leading to significant cultural changes and often resulting in inequalities and conflicts that persist even after the end of colonial rule. The motivations for colonialism have varied throughout history, including economic gain, political power, strategic advantage, and the spread of religious or cultural beliefs. The study of colonialism examines its historical roots, its various forms and impacts, and its enduring legacies in the contemporary world.

Causal relation: {Colonialism, Neo-colonialism} → exploits → {Exploitation_Theory, Underdevelopment}

Semantical explanation of neo-colonialism_ID000001: 
Neo-colonialism refers to a new form of global power relationship that involves not direct political control over former colonies, but rather economic exploitation and dominance exerted by powerful multinational corporations and global financial institutions based in developed countries over less developed nations. In this system, former colonies or developing countries may be politically independent but remain economically dependent on and vulnerable to the interests of these powerful economic actors from the developed world. This dependence can manifest through control over key industries, trade imbalances, debt burdens, and the influence of international financial policies that may benefit wealthy nations at the expense of poorer ones. Neo-colonialism suggests that the patterns of global inequality established during the colonial era persist through economic mechanisms rather than direct political rule.

Causal relation: {Colonialism, Neo-colonialism} → exploits → {Exploitation_Theory, Underdevelopment}

Semantical explanation of exploitation_Theory_ID000001: 
Exploitation theory, particularly within a Marxist framework, views racial subordination in the United States and other capitalist societies as a manifestation of the class system inherent in capitalism. This theory argues that racism and racial inequality serve the interests of the capitalist class by creating a split labor market, where workers are divided along racial lines, leading to lower wages for all workers and hindering the development of class consciousness and solidarity among the working class. By fostering racial antagonism, the bourgeoisie can maintain their power and profits by preventing the unified mobilisation of workers against their exploitation. Exploitation theory suggests that racial prejudice and discrimination are not simply matters of individual attitudes but are deeply embedded in the economic structure of capitalism and serve to perpetuate class inequality.

Causal relation: {Colonialism, Neo-colonialism} → exploits → {Exploitation_Theory, Underdevelopment}

Semantical explanation of underdevelopment_ID000001: 
Underdevelopment is a concept used in social science, particularly in the context of global inequality and post-colonial studies, to describe the economic state of societies, primarily in the Global South, that were historically exploited and/or previously colonised by Western countries during the periods of colonialism. This perspective suggests that the current state of poverty and limited economic development in many of these societies is not simply a natural or inevitable condition but is, in part, a result of historical processes of exploitation and dependence imposed by powerful, wealthy states, which actively extracted resources, disrupted local economies, and established unequal trade relationships that continue to disadvantage these nations. Underdevelopment theory emphasises the historical and ongoing power dynamics between developed and developing countries, highlighting how the wealth and prosperity of some nations may have been built upon the exploitation and impoverishment of others, perpetuating a cycle of dependence and hindering genuine economic development in the formerly colonised regions.

Semantical explanation of group_ID000001: 
In sociology, a group is defined as any number of people with similar norms, values, and expectations who interact with one another on a regular basis, developing a sense of shared identity and belonging. The size of a group can range from a small dyad (two people) to large-scale organisations or even broader social categories. What distinguishes a group from a mere collection of individuals is the presence of ongoing social interaction, shared norms and values that guide behaviour, and a sense of mutual awareness and interdependence among members. Groups play a fundamental role in social life, providing individuals with social support, a sense of identity, and a context for social interaction and the development of social norms. Sociologists study groups to understand group dynamics, social influence, conformity, leadership, and the ways in which groups shape individual behaviour and social structures.

Causal relation: {Group, Social_Mobility} → mobilises → {Social_Change, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of social_Mobility_ID000001: 
Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals or groups from one position to another within a society's stratification system, which is the hierarchical arrangement of social positions based on factors like wealth, income, occupation, education, and social status. This movement can be upward, representing an improvement in social standing (e.g., moving from a working-class job to a professional occupation), or downward, indicating a decline in social position (e.g., due to unemployment or business failure). Social mobility can occur within an individual's lifetime (intragenerational mobility) or across generations (intergenerational mobility, comparing the social position of children to that of their parents). The degree of social mobility in a society is often seen as an indicator of its openness and the extent to which individuals can change their social standing based on their achievements and efforts rather than being limited by their ascribed status at birth.

Causal relation: {Group, Social_Mobility} → mobilises → {Social_Change, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of social_Structure_ID000001: 
Social structure refers to the underlying patterns of social relationships, institutions, and social organisation that shape and constrain individuals' behaviour and interactions within a society, providing a framework for social life. It is the way in which a society is organised into predictable relationships and hierarchies based on factors such as social class, gender, race, ethnicity, age, and social institutions like the family, education, government, and the economy. Social structure is not always immediately visible but exerts a powerful influence on individuals' opportunities, experiences, and life chances. Sociologists study social structure to understand the enduring patterns of social behaviour and the ways in which society is organised at a macro level.

Causal relation: {White-collar_Crime, Corporate_Crime} → influencesHistorically → {Economic_System, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of white-collar_Crime_ID000001: 
White-collar crime refers to a range of financially motivated nonviolent crimes that are typically committed by affluent individuals or corporations in the course of their daily business or professional activities, often involving deception, fraud, or breach of trust. These crimes can include offenses such as embezzlement, tax evasion, insider trading, securities fraud, corporate fraud, bribery, and environmental violations. Unlike street crimes that often involve physical violence or property damage, white-collar crimes typically involve financial manipulation and can result in significant economic losses to individuals, organisations, and society as a whole, as well as eroding public trust in institutions and markets. Despite often being less visible than other forms of crime, white-collar crime can have far-reaching and damaging consequences.

Causal relation: {White-collar_Crime, Corporate_Crime} → influencesHistorically → {Economic_System, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of corporate_Crime_ID000001: 
Corporate crime refers to offences committed by large corporations in society in the pursuit of profit or to avoid losses. These crimes are often non-violent but can have significant social, environmental, and economic consequences. Examples of corporate crime include pollution of air and water, false advertising and deceptive marketing practices, violations of health and safety regulations in the workplace, financial fraud, and the production and sale of unsafe products. Unlike street crime, corporate crime is often more complex and difficult to detect and prosecute, as it may involve intricate financial transactions and decision-making processes within large organisations. The impact of corporate crime can be widespread, affecting consumers, employees, the environment, and the public trust in corporations and regulatory agencies.

Semantical explanation of economic_System_ID000001: 
An economic system is the social institution through which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed within a society. It encompasses the organisational arrangements, rules, and practices that govern how a society allocates its resources to satisfy the needs and wants of its members. Different societies have adopted various types of economic systems throughout history, including traditional economies, command economies, market economies (capitalism), and mixed economies that combine elements of different systems. Each type of economic system has its own set of principles regarding ownership of resources, decision-making processes, and mechanisms for production, distribution, and consumption. The dominant economic system in a society has a profound impact on its social structure, levels of inequality, and the daily lives of its people.

Semantical explanation of social_Inequality_ID000002: 
Social inequality refers to a condition within a society in which its members have significantly different amounts of wealth, income, prestige, power, or other valued resources and opportunities. This unequal distribution can be based on various social categories such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability, often resulting in hierarchical arrangements where some groups have more access to resources and privileges than others. Social inequality is a fundamental topic of study in sociology, with researchers examining its causes, consequences, and the ways in which it is maintained and challenged over time.

Causal relation: {Multinational_Corporations, Sweatshop} → exploits → {Exploitation_Theory, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of multinational_Corporations_ID000001: 
Multinational corporations (MNCs) are large commercial organisations that are headquartered in one country (the home country) but conduct business operations, including production, marketing, sales, and research and development, in numerous other countries around the world (host countries). These corporations often have significant economic power and play a major role in the global economy through foreign direct investment, international trade, and the transfer of technology and capital across borders. MNCs can have both positive and negative impacts on the countries in which they operate, providing jobs and investment but also potentially raising issues related to labor practices, environmental regulations, and economic sovereignty. The study of multinational corporations is an important area in sociology, particularly in the context of globalisation and its effects on national economies and societies.

Causal relation: {Multinational_Corporations, Sweatshop} → exploits → {Exploitation_Theory, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of sweatshop_ID000001: 
Sweatshop is a derogatory term used to describe a factory, workshop, or other place of work in which employees are subjected to exploitative labor practices, including working long hours for very low wages, often under poor, unsafe, or unhealthy working conditions that may violate labor laws and basic human rights. Sweatshops are often associated with industries that have high labor intensity and operate in countries or regions with lax labor regulations or weak enforcement, where the pressure to produce goods at very low costs can lead to the exploitation of workers, including women and children. The issue of sweatshops has gained international attention due to concerns about fair labor practices, human rights, and the ethical implications of global supply chains.

Causal relation: {Multinational_Corporations, Sweatshop} → exploits → {Exploitation_Theory, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of exploitation_Theory_ID000002: 
Exploitation theory, particularly within a Marxist framework, views racial subordination in the United States and other capitalist societies as a manifestation of the class system inherent in capitalism. This theory argues that racism and racial inequality serve the interests of the capitalist class by creating a split labor market, where workers are divided along racial lines, leading to lower wages for all workers and hindering the development of class consciousness and solidarity among the working class. By fostering racial antagonism, the bourgeoisie can maintain their power and profits by preventing the unified mobilisation of workers against their exploitation. Exploitation theory suggests that racial prejudice and discrimination are not simply matters of individual attitudes but are deeply embedded in the economic structure of capitalism and serve to perpetuate class inequality.

Causal relation: {Multinational_Corporations, Sweatshop} → exploits → {Exploitation_Theory, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000005: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Causal relation: {Multinational_Corporations, Monopoly} → controls → {Economic_System, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of monopoly_ID000001: 
Monopoly refers to the control of a particular market or industry by a single business firm, giving that firm the power to dominate the market without significant competition. In a monopoly, the single firm is the sole producer or seller of a specific product or service, allowing it to set prices, control supply, and potentially limit consumer choice. This lack of competition can lead to higher prices, lower quality, and reduced innovation compared to markets with multiple competing firms. Monopolies can arise due to various factors, such as government regulations granting exclusive rights, the control of essential resources, high barriers to entry that prevent new firms from competing, or network effects where the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. While some monopolies may be considered natural due to inherent efficiencies of scale in certain industries, they are often subject to government regulation and antitrust laws aimed at preventing unfair competition and protecting consumer interests. The existence of a monopoly can have significant implications for the economy and society, affecting market dynamics, consumer welfare, and the distribution of wealth.

Semantical explanation of capital_Punishment_ID000001: 
Capital punishment is the state-sanctioned execution of a person who has been convicted of a crime that is punishable by death. Commonly known as the 'death penalty', it is a highly debated topic with strong ethical, moral, and legal arguments both for and against its use. Proponents often argue for its effectiveness as a deterrent to crime and as a just retribution for heinous offenses, while opponents raise concerns about its irreversibility, potential for error, and moral implications, often citing issues of human rights and cruel and unusual punishment. The application of capital punishment varies significantly across countries and jurisdictions, with differing views on which crimes warrant such a severe penalty.

Causal relation: {Capital_Punishment, Formal_Social_Control} → sanctions → {Crime, Rehabilitation}

Semantical explanation of formal_Social_Control_ID000001: 
Formal social control refers to the mechanisms and processes used by authorised agents and institutions within society to maintain order, enforce laws, and ensure conformity to established norms and rules. These agents include police officers, judges, school administrators, employers, and other individuals who have been given the authority to enforce social norms and impose sanctions when violations occur. Formal social control is characterised by its reliance on written rules, laws, and regulations, as well as established procedures for identifying and punishing deviant behaviour. Examples of formal social control mechanisms include arrests, prosecutions, disciplinary actions, and legal penalties. It plays a crucial role in maintaining social stability and protecting societal values and interests, often working in conjunction with informal social control mechanisms, such as social disapproval and peer pressure.

Causal relation: {Capital_Punishment, Formal_Social_Control} → sanctions → {Crime, Rehabilitation}

Semantical explanation of crime_ID000002: 
Crime is a violation of criminal law for which formal penalties are applied by some governmental authority. What constitutes a crime is defined by legal statutes at the local, state, or federal level, and these definitions can vary across jurisdictions and change over time. Crimes are typically classified based on their severity, ranging from minor offenses (misdemeanors) to serious felonies. The criminal justice system, including law enforcement agencies, courts, and correctional institutions, is responsible for enforcing criminal laws, apprehending offenders, and administering penalties, which can include fines, probation, imprisonment, or, in some cases, capital punishment. Sociologists study crime from various perspectives, examining its social causes, patterns, and consequences, as well as the functioning of the criminal justice system and its impact on society.

Causal relation: {Capital_Punishment, Formal_Social_Control} → sanctions → {Crime, Rehabilitation}

Semantical explanation of rehabilitation_ID000001: 
Rehabilitation, in the context of criminology and sociology, refers to a planned and systematic program or process aimed at reforming an offender's attitudes, behaviours, and skills in order to reduce the likelihood of future offenses and facilitate their reintegration into society as law-abiding citizens. Rehabilitation programs can take various forms, including educational and vocational training, therapy and counseling to address underlying issues contributing to criminal behaviour (such as substance abuse or mental health problems), and restorative justice initiatives that focus on repairing the harm caused by the crime and promoting empathy and accountability. The goal of rehabilitation is to address the root causes of crime and provide offenders with the tools and support they need to lead productive and crime-free lives upon release from correctional facilities or completion of their sentences.

Causal relation: {Diffusion, Cultural_Capital} → hasInfluence → {Innovation, Social_Change}

Semantical explanation of diffusion_ID000001: 
Diffusion is the process by which a cultural item, such as an idea, innovation, practice, or material object, is spread from one group to another or from one society to another. This can occur through various forms of contact, including trade, migration, communication, and conquest. Cultural diffusion plays a significant role in cultural change, as societies are constantly borrowing and adapting elements from other cultures. The rate and extent of diffusion can be influenced by factors such as the compatibility of the new cultural item with existing cultural elements, the social status of the adopters, and the intensity of contact between the groups. Diffusion can lead to both cultural enrichment and cultural homogenisation, depending on the specific context and the nature of the cultural exchange.

Causal relation: {Diffusion, Cultural_Capital} → hasInfluence → {Innovation, Social_Change}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Capital_ID000001: 
Cultural capital, a concept developed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, refers to the types of knowledge, skills, education, and other cultural resources that confer advantages on those who acquire them, providing them with social mobility and status within a society. Bourdieu identified three forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalised. Embodied cultural capital exists in the form of knowledge and skills that are consciously acquired and passively inherited, such as language proficiency, manners, tastes, and dispositions. These are often learned through socialisation within a particular social class or cultural environment. Objectified cultural capital refers to cultural goods such as books, artworks, musical instruments, and other material objects that can be owned and transmitted. However, the possession of these objects is not sufficient; one must also have the cultural competence to understand and appreciate them to fully benefit from this form of capital. Institutionalised cultural capital consists of academic credentials, professional qualifications, and other forms of formal recognition that legitimate an individual's cultural competence and confer social advantages in the labor market and other social institutions. Cultural capital plays a significant role in social reproduction, as individuals from privileged backgrounds often possess more cultural capital, which helps them succeed in educational systems and gain access to higher-status occupations, thereby perpetuating social inequalities across generations.

Semantical explanation of innovation_ID000002: 
Innovation is the process of introducing new elements, ideas, methods, or products into a culture or society, leading to change and often improvement. This can occur through two primary mechanisms: discovery and invention. Discovery involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown or unrecognised, such as a new scientific fact or a previously unknown natural resource. Invention, on the other hand, involves creating something entirely new that did not exist before, such as a new technology, a new tool, or a new process. Both discovery and invention can have profound impacts on a culture, leading to new practices, beliefs, social structures, and material advancements. The rate and nature of innovation can vary significantly across different societies and historical periods, influenced by factors such as technological development, cultural values, and social organisation.

Semantical explanation of social_Change_ID000003: 
Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Semantical explanation of hegemony_ID000001: 
Hegemony, in a sociological context, refers to the means by which a ruling or dominant group wins over a subordinate group through ideas, values, beliefs, and cultural norms, rather than primarily through force or coercion. This concept, often associated with the work of Antonio Gramsci, describes a process where the dominant group's ideology becomes widely accepted as common sense or the natural order of things, even by those who are disadvantaged by it, thereby maintaining the dominant group's power and control. Hegemony operates by shaping people's perceptions, preferences, and understandings of the world in ways that support the status quo. It is a subtle form of power that works through cultural influence and the shaping of consciousness, making social inequalities seem legitimate or inevitable.

Causal relation: {Hegemony, Power_Elite} → controls → {Culture, Mass_Media}

Semantical explanation of power_Elite_ID000001: 
Power elite is a term popularised by sociologist C. Wright Mills to describe a relatively small, tightly knit group of individuals who occupy the top positions in the dominant institutions of American societyâ€”namely, the military, the industrial (corporate) sector, and the governmentâ€”and who collectively hold the most power and make key decisions that shape the fate of the United States. According to Mills, these elites share similar backgrounds, interests, and worldviews, and their decisions have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the population, often operating outside of traditional democratic processes and accountability. The theory of the power elite suggests that power in modern industrial societies is concentrated rather than widely dispersed.

Semantical explanation of culture_ID000001: 
Culture encompasses the values, beliefs, ceremonies, ways of life, norms, symbols, and material goods characteristic of a given group or society. Like the concept of society, the notion of culture is very widely used in sociology, as well as in other social sciences, particularly anthropology. Culture is one of the most distinctive properties of human social association, differentiating human societies from animal societies in its complexity and transmission through learning rather than solely through instinct. It includes everything that is learned and shared by the members of a society, shaping their behaviour and their understanding of the world. Culture can be broadly divided into material culture, which includes tangible objects created by a society (such as tools, technology, clothing, and art), and nonmaterial culture, which includes intangible aspects such as ideas, values, beliefs, norms, language, and social institutions. Culture provides a framework for social interaction, defines what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and gives meaning to people's lives. It is dynamic and constantly evolving through processes of innovation, diffusion, and adaptation.

Causal relation: {Hegemony, Power_Elite} → controls → {Culture, Mass_Media}

Semantical explanation of mass_Media_ID000001: 
Mass media refers to forms of communication, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television, films, and the internet, that are designed to reach and influence very large audiences, often simultaneously. These media play a significant role in shaping public opinion, disseminating information, transmitting cultural values and norms, and providing entertainment. The development and widespread availability of mass media have had a profound impact on society, influencing everything from political campaigns and consumer behaviour to popular culture and social movements. Sociologists study mass media to understand its effects on individuals and society, including issues related to media ownership, content, audience reception, and the role of media in shaping social identities and perceptions of reality. The rise of digital and social media has further transformed the landscape of mass communication, creating new opportunities and challenges for how information is produced, distributed, and consumed.

Causal relation: {Culture, Values} → hasInfluence → {Identity, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of values_ID000002: 
Values are culturally defined standards or principles that are widely shared by members of a society or group and serve as broad guidelines for social living, indicating what people assess as desirable, good, beautiful, right, or important. Values provide a moral compass for behaviour, influencing people's attitudes, choices, and actions across various aspects of life, and they often form the basis for social norms, which are more specific rules and expectations for behaviour. Values can vary significantly across different cultures and can change over time within a society, reflecting evolving beliefs and priorities. They play a crucial role in shaping social cohesion, cultural identity, and the overall character of a society, and they are often transmitted from one generation to the next through the process of socialisation.

Causal relation: {Culture, Values} → hasInfluence → {Identity, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of identity_ID000002: 
Identity refers to the distinctive characteristics of a person's character or the character of a group which relate to who they are and what is meaningful to them, providing a sense of self and belonging. Some of the main sources of identity include gender, encompassing social expectations of masculinity and femininity; sexual orientation, referring to patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction; nationality or ethnicity, based on shared cultural heritage, origin, and often language or religion; and social class, reflecting one's position in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Identity is not fixed but is fluid and can evolve over an individual's life course through interactions with others and within different social contexts. It shapes how individuals perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others, influencing their social interactions, opportunities, and experiences within society.

Causal relation: {Culture, Values} → hasInfluence → {Identity, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of social_Roles_ID000001: 
Social_Roles represents the organised system of behavioural expectations, positions, and identities that individuals occupy within social structures and through which social interaction is organised and regulated. This category encompasses the fundamental mechanisms through which societies organise human behaviour and social relationships, including both positions that individuals achieve through their actions and those that are ascribed based on characteristics beyond their control. The concept includes the hierarchical dimension of social positions through status systems and the specialised behavioural expectations associated with particular social positions. Gender roles represent culturally defined expectations based on sex categories, while the sick role exemplifies how societies organise responses to illness and health conditions. Master status refers to dominant identity categories that override other social positions in social interaction. The category captures how societies create and maintain social order through the assignment and performance of differentiated roles that coordinate individual behaviour with collective needs and expectations. These roles serve as bridges between individual identity and social structure, providing frameworks for social interaction, identity formation, and the reproduction of social patterns across time and social contexts.

Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Causal relation: {Culture, Values} → hasInfluence → {Social_Change, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of social_Structure_ID000002: 
Social structure refers to the underlying patterns of social relationships, institutions, and social organisation that shape and constrain individuals' behaviour and interactions within a society, providing a framework for social life. It is the way in which a society is organised into predictable relationships and hierarchies based on factors such as social class, gender, race, ethnicity, age, and social institutions like the family, education, government, and the economy. Social structure is not always immediately visible but exerts a powerful influence on individuals' opportunities, experiences, and life chances. Sociologists study social structure to understand the enduring patterns of social behaviour and the ways in which society is organised at a macro level.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Capital, Family} → reproduces → {Social_Class, Social_Mobility}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Capital_ID000002: 
Cultural capital, a concept developed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, refers to the types of knowledge, skills, education, and other cultural resources that confer advantages on those who acquire them, providing them with social mobility and status within a society. Bourdieu identified three forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalised. Embodied cultural capital exists in the form of knowledge and skills that are consciously acquired and passively inherited, such as language proficiency, manners, tastes, and dispositions. These are often learned through socialisation within a particular social class or cultural environment. Objectified cultural capital refers to cultural goods such as books, artworks, musical instruments, and other material objects that can be owned and transmitted. However, the possession of these objects is not sufficient; one must also have the cultural competence to understand and appreciate them to fully benefit from this form of capital. Institutionalised cultural capital consists of academic credentials, professional qualifications, and other forms of formal recognition that legitimate an individual's cultural competence and confer social advantages in the labor market and other social institutions. Cultural capital plays a significant role in social reproduction, as individuals from privileged backgrounds often possess more cultural capital, which helps them succeed in educational systems and gain access to higher-status occupations, thereby perpetuating social inequalities across generations.

Semantical explanation of family_ID000001: 
A family is a group of individuals related to one another by blood ties, marriage, or adoption who form an economic unit, the adult members of which are responsible for the upbringing of children. All known societies involve some form of family system, although the nature of family relationships is widely variable across cultures and throughout history. While in modern societies the main family form is often considered the nuclear family (a couple and their dependent children), a variety of extended family relationships (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) are also frequently found and play important roles in individuals' lives. The family serves as a primary agent of socialisation, providing emotional support, care, and a sense of belonging for its members. It also plays a crucial role in the transmission of cultural norms, values, and traditions across generations.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Capital, Family} → reproduces → {Social_Class, Social_Mobility}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000001: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Capital, Family} → reproduces → {Social_Class, Social_Mobility}

Semantical explanation of social_Mobility_ID000002: 
Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals or groups from one position to another within a society's stratification system, which is the hierarchical arrangement of social positions based on factors like wealth, income, occupation, education, and social status. This movement can be upward, representing an improvement in social standing (e.g., moving from a working-class job to a professional occupation), or downward, indicating a decline in social position (e.g., due to unemployment or business failure). Social mobility can occur within an individual's lifetime (intragenerational mobility) or across generations (intergenerational mobility, comparing the social position of children to that of their parents). The degree of social mobility in a society is often seen as an indicator of its openness and the extent to which individuals can change their social standing based on their achievements and efforts rather than being limited by their ascribed status at birth.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Transmission, Education} → transmits → {Culture, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Transmission_ID000001: 
Cultural transmission is the process by which one generation passes culture to the next, ensuring the continuity of societal norms, values, beliefs, traditions, and practices. This process occurs through various mechanisms, including socialisation within the family, formal education in schools, informal learning from peers and community members, and exposure to media and cultural products. Language is a fundamental tool for cultural transmission, allowing for the communication of knowledge, history, and cultural values across generations. Traditions, rituals, and storytelling also play important roles in passing down cultural heritage. Cultural transmission is essential for the survival and development of societies, as it enables each new generation to learn from the experiences and knowledge of those who came before them, contributing to social stability and cultural evolution. The effectiveness of cultural transmission can influence the rate and direction of cultural change within a society.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Transmission, Education} → transmits → {Culture, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of education_ID000001: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility. Sociologists study education to understand its impact on social inequality, its relationship to the economy, and its role in shaping individual identities and life chances.

Semantical explanation of culture_ID000004: 
Culture encompasses the values, beliefs, ceremonies, ways of life, norms, symbols, and material goods characteristic of a given group or society. Like the concept of society, the notion of culture is very widely used in sociology, as well as in other social sciences, particularly anthropology. Culture is one of the most distinctive properties of human social association, differentiating human societies from animal societies in its complexity and transmission through learning rather than solely through instinct. It includes everything that is learned and shared by the members of a society, shaping their behaviour and their understanding of the world. Culture can be broadly divided into material culture, which includes tangible objects created by a society (such as tools, technology, clothing, and art), and nonmaterial culture, which includes intangible aspects such as ideas, values, beliefs, norms, language, and social institutions. Culture provides a framework for social interaction, defines what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and gives meaning to people's lives. It is dynamic and constantly evolving through processes of innovation, diffusion, and adaptation.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Transmission, Education} → transmits → {Culture, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Capital_ID000003: 
Cultural capital, a concept developed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, refers to the types of knowledge, skills, education, and other cultural resources that confer advantages on those who acquire them, providing them with social mobility and status within a society. Bourdieu identified three forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalised. Embodied cultural capital exists in the form of knowledge and skills that are consciously acquired and passively inherited, such as language proficiency, manners, tastes, and dispositions. These are often learned through socialisation within a particular social class or cultural environment. Objectified cultural capital refers to cultural goods such as books, artworks, musical instruments, and other material objects that can be owned and transmitted. However, the possession of these objects is not sufficient; one must also have the cultural competence to understand and appreciate them to fully benefit from this form of capital. Institutionalised cultural capital consists of academic credentials, professional qualifications, and other forms of formal recognition that legitimate an individual's cultural competence and confer social advantages in the labor market and other social institutions. Cultural capital plays a significant role in social reproduction, as individuals from privileged backgrounds often possess more cultural capital, which helps them succeed in educational systems and gain access to higher-status occupations, thereby perpetuating social inequalities across generations.

Causal relation: {Deindustrialisation, Economic_System} → influencesHistorically → {Working_Class, Relative_Deprivation}

Semantical explanation of deindustrialisation_ID000001: 
Deindustrialisation is the systematic, widespread withdrawal of investment in basic aspects of productivity such as factories and plants, leading to a decline in manufacturing and industrial activity in a region or country. This process is often accompanied by a shift towards a service-based economy, with a greater emphasis on sectors like finance, information technology, and healthcare. Deindustrialisation can be caused by various factors, including technological advancements that automate production, the globalisation of manufacturing leading to production moving to countries with lower labor costs, and a shift in consumer demand towards services rather than manufactured goods. While deindustrialisation can lead to economic restructuring and the emergence of new industries, it can also result in job losses in the manufacturing sector, economic hardship for affected communities, and increased social inequality if new opportunities are not readily available or accessible to all. The social and economic consequences of deindustrialisation have been a significant area of study in sociology, with researchers examining its impact on employment, social class, and community well-being.

Semantical explanation of economic_System_ID000003: 
An economic system is the social institution through which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed within a society. It encompasses the organisational arrangements, rules, and practices that govern how a society allocates its resources to satisfy the needs and wants of its members. Different societies have adopted various types of economic systems throughout history, including traditional economies, command economies, market economies (capitalism), and mixed economies that combine elements of different systems. Each type of economic system has its own set of principles regarding ownership of resources, decision-making processes, and mechanisms for production, distribution, and consumption. The dominant economic system in a society has a profound impact on its social structure, levels of inequality, and the daily lives of its people.

Causal relation: {Deindustrialisation, Economic_System} → influencesHistorically → {Working_Class, Relative_Deprivation}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000006: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Causal relation: {Deindustrialisation, Economic_System} → influencesHistorically → {Working_Class, Relative_Deprivation}

Semantical explanation of relative_Deprivation_ID000001: 
Relative deprivation is the thesis that people's subjective feelings of deprivation, discontent, or grievance are not absolute or based on an objective standard of poverty or need, but rather are relative to their assessment of themselves and their situation in comparison with others around them, particularly those they perceive as being more privileged or having more of what they desire. This feeling of being disadvantaged can arise even when one's basic needs are met, if one believes they are unfairly lacking in comparison to a relevant reference group or societal standards. The experience of relative deprivation can be a significant factor in social unrest, the formation of social movements, and the expression of social discontent, as people strive to achieve what they perceive as equitable or just in relation to others.

Semantical explanation of democracy_ID000001: 
Democracy is a political system in which power is exercised by the people as a whole, either directly or through elected representatives. Key principles of democracy typically include free and fair elections, the rule of law, protection of individual rights and freedoms (such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press), and the accountability of government to the people. Democratic systems can take various forms, such as parliamentary democracies, presidential democracies, and direct democracies, each with its own specific structures and processes for decision-making and governance. The concept of democracy is often associated with values such as equality, participation, and the consent of the governed. The spread and consolidation of democracy have been major themes in political sociology, with researchers studying the factors that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of democratic institutions around the world.

Causal relation: {Democracy, Politics} → influencesHistorically → {Social_Movement, Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of politics_ID000002: 
Politics, in Harold D. Lasswell's classic definition, is fundamentally about "who gets what, when, and how," highlighting the struggle for power and resources within a society and the processes through which decisions are made about their distribution and allocation. It involves the exercise of power and influence to shape policies, make collective decisions, and resolve conflicts over competing interests and values. Politics operates at various levels, from interpersonal relationships and small groups to national and international arenas, and is a central aspect of social organisation and governance.

Causal relation: {Democracy, Politics} → influencesHistorically → {Social_Movement, Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of social_Movement_ID000003: 
A social movement encompasses collective attempts by a group of people to further a common interest or secure a shared goal through organised action that typically takes place outside the sphere of established political institutions and conventional channels. These movements often arise in response to perceived social, economic, or political grievances and seek to bring about or resist social change, existing in a dynamic relationship, often one of conflict, with organisations or power structures whose objectives and outlook they frequently oppose. Social movements can vary widely in their goals, tactics, organisational structures, and the scale of change they aim to achieve, ranging from advocating for specific policy reforms to seeking fundamental transformations in societal norms and values. While they operate outside of formal political systems, successful social movements can sometimes influence policy and, if they manage to gain significant power and become institutionalised, may evolve into formal organisations or even political parties.

Causal relation: {Democracy, Politics} → influencesHistorically → {Social_Movement, Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of collective_Behaviour_ID000002: 
Collective behaviour encompasses activities of people and social groups that typically emerge spontaneously (such as crowds, riots, and so on) rather than arising from established processes of socialisation leading to conformity to social rules and norms. These behaviours often occur in response to a shared situation or stimulus and can involve large numbers of people acting in relatively unstructured ways. Examples of collective behaviour include panics, fads, rumors, social movements, and disasters. Sociologists study collective behaviour to understand the dynamics of group actions that are not governed by typical social structures or institutions. Factors such as anonymity, suggestibility, and the rapid spread of information can play a significant role in shaping collective behaviour.

This form of democracy is common in large and complex societies where direct participation by all citizens in every decision may be impractical. Elected representatives are typically accountable to their constituents and may be removed from office through regular elections if they fail to represent their interests effectively.

Semantical explanation of nation_State_ID000001: 
A nation state is a political apparatus that exercises sovereignty and authority over a specific territory, with a population of citizens who typically share a strong sense of national identity, often reinforced by common cultural characteristics such as language, religion, and a perceived shared history, and whose authority is backed up by military force and a nationalistic, sovereign creed. The concept of a nation state combines the political entity of the state with the cultural and social entity of the nation, where the state is seen as representing and protecting the interests and identity of the nation within its defined borders. The rise of the nation state is a key feature of modern political history, particularly in Europe, and it continues to be the dominant form of political organisation globally, although the relationship between nation and state can be complex and contested, especially in diverse or multinational states.

Semantical explanation of democracy_ID000003: 
Democracy is a political system in which power is exercised by the people as a whole, either directly or through elected representatives. Key principles of democracy typically include free and fair elections, the rule of law, protection of individual rights and freedoms (such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press), and the accountability of government to the people. Democratic systems can take various forms, such as parliamentary democracies, presidential democracies, and direct democracies, each with its own specific structures and processes for decision-making and governance. The concept of democracy is often associated with values such as equality, participation, and the consent of the governed. The spread and consolidation of democracy have been major themes in political sociology, with researchers studying the factors that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of democratic institutions around the world.

Causal relation: {Democracy, Liberal_Democracy} → participatesIn → {Politics, Representative_Democracy}

Semantical explanation of liberal_Democracy_ID000001: 
Liberal democracy is a system of democracy that combines parliamentary institutions, such as free and fair elections, representative government, and the rule of law, with a commitment to the protection of individual rights and freedoms, coupled with a free market system in the area of economic production. In a liberal democracy, the government's power is limited by a constitution and the separation of powers, and citizens have fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, and religion. The economic aspect of liberal democracy typically involves a capitalist system with private ownership of property and the means of production, although there may be varying degrees of government regulation and social welfare provisions. This form of government is prevalent in many Western industrialised nations and is characterised by a balance between individual liberties and democratic governance.

Semantical explanation of politics_ID000003: 
Politics, in Harold D. Lasswell's classic definition, is fundamentally about "who gets what, when, and how," highlighting the struggle for power and resources within a society and the processes through which decisions are made about their distribution and allocation. It involves the exercise of power and influence to shape policies, make collective decisions, and resolve conflicts over competing interests and values. Politics operates at various levels, from interpersonal relationships and small groups to national and international arenas, and is a central aspect of social organisation and governance.

Semantical explanation of representative_Democracy_ID000002: 
Representative democracy is a political system in which decisions affecting a community or society as a whole are not taken directly by its members but rather by a smaller group of people whom they have elected through a process of voting to represent their interests and make decisions on their behalf. This form of democracy is common in large and complex societies where direct participation by all citizens in every decision may be impractical. Elected representatives are typically accountable to their constituents and may be removed from office through regular elections if they fail to represent their interests effectively.

Causal relation: {Deviance} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of deviance_ID000002: 
Deviance refers to behaviour that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society. What is considered deviant varies across cultures, social groups, and time periods, as it is defined by social norms and values. Deviant behaviour can range from minor infractions of social norms to serious violations of laws. Sociologists study deviance to understand why people violate norms, how societies react to deviance, and the role of deviance in social change. Various theories attempt to explain deviance, including anomie theory, differential association theory, control theory, and labeling theory. Deviance is not inherently negative; while some deviant acts are harmful, others can challenge existing norms and lead to social progress.

Causal relation: {Deviance} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of social_Exclusion_ID000002: 
Social exclusion is a complex and multidimensional process and outcome where individuals or groups are prevented from fully participating in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of the society in which they are located due to a combination of multiple and often intersecting deprivations. These deprivations can include lack of adequate income and resources, limited access to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and social support networks, as well as experiences of discrimination, marginalisation, and a lack of voice or power in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Social exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and a diminished sense of belonging, hindering individuals' ability to exercise their rights, fulfill their potential, and participate as full and valued members of society. Addressing social exclusion requires tackling the various interconnected factors that contribute to it through inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and social integration for all members of society.

Semantical explanation of diffusion_ID000002: 
Diffusion is the process by which a cultural item, such as an idea, innovation, practice, or material object, is spread from one group to another or from one society to another. This can occur through various forms of contact, including trade, migration, communication, and conquest. Cultural diffusion plays a significant role in cultural change, as societies are constantly borrowing and adapting elements from other cultures. The rate and extent of diffusion can be influenced by factors such as the compatibility of the new cultural item with existing cultural elements, the social status of the adopters, and the intensity of contact between the groups. Diffusion can lead to both cultural enrichment and cultural homogenisation, depending on the specific context and the nature of the cultural exchange.

Causal relation: {Diffusion} → hasInfluence → {Innovation}

Semantical explanation of innovation_ID000003: 
Innovation is the process of introducing new elements, ideas, methods, or products into a culture or society, leading to change and often improvement. This can occur through two primary mechanisms: discovery and invention. Discovery involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown or unrecognised, such as a new scientific fact or a previously unknown natural resource. Invention, on the other hand, involves creating something entirely new that did not exist before, such as a new technology, a new tool, or a new process. Both discovery and invention can have profound impacts on a culture, leading to new practices, beliefs, social structures, and material advancements. The rate and nature of innovation can vary significantly across different societies and historical periods, influenced by factors such as technological development, cultural values, and social organisation.

Semantical explanation of cyberspace_ID000001: 
Cyberspace refers to electronic networks of interaction between individuals at different computer terminals, linking people at a level â€“ in a dimension â€“ that has no regard for territorial boundaries or physical presence. It is a virtual realm created by interconnected computer networks, primarily the internet, where individuals can communicate, interact, and exchange information regardless of their physical location. Cyberspace encompasses a wide range of online activities, including social networking, email communication, online shopping, virtual gaming, and accessing information through the World Wide Web. The nature of cyberspace allows for the formation of online communities based on shared interests, identities, or goals, transcending geographical limitations. This virtual environment has become an increasingly significant space for social interaction, economic activity, and cultural exchange in modern society. The lack of physical presence and territorial boundaries in cyberspace raises unique social, ethical, and legal challenges related to issues such as privacy, security, and governance.

Causal relation: {Internet, Cyberspace} → digitalises → {Social_Interaction, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of social_Interaction_ID000001: 
Social interaction is the fundamental process by which people act and react in relation to others, involving communication, mutual influence, and the creation of shared meanings and social bonds. It occurs at all levels of social life, from brief encounters between strangers to long-term relationships within families and close-knit groups, and in formal settings like workplaces and organisations as well as informal settings like social gatherings. Social interaction can take various forms, including verbal communication, nonverbal cues such as gestures and facial expressions, and the exchange of symbols and meanings. It is through social interaction that individuals develop their sense of self, learn social norms, establish relationships, and collectively construct social reality. The study of social interaction is a core focus of microsociology, aiming to understand the patterns and dynamics of everyday social life.

Causal relation: {Internet, Cyberspace} → digitalises → {Social_Interaction, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of social_Cohesion_ID000001: 
Social Cohesion refers to the degree of solidarity, unity, and sense of belonging that exists among individuals and groups within a society, reflecting the bonds that tie people together and enable them to live and work together effectively. It is characterised by shared values, common norms, mutual trust, and a willingness to cooperate for the collective good. Ã‰mile Durkheim identified two types of social cohesion: mechanical solidarity, found in traditional societies based on homogeneity and shared morality, and organic solidarity, prevalent in modern, complex societies based on interdependence and specialisation. High levels of social cohesion contribute to social stability, order, and collective well-being, fostering a sense of community and mutual support. Conversely, a lack of social cohesion can lead to social disorganisation, conflict, and a sense of anomie or normlessness among individuals.

Semantical explanation of internet_ID000003: 
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that allows people to communicate with one another and find information on the Worldwide Web by exchanging data in various forms, including visuals, sounds, and text. This vast network operates in a way that largely transcends the limitations of time, physical space, and the traditional costs and control mechanisms associated with distance and territorial governments. The Internet has become an indispensable tool for communication, education, commerce, entertainment, and social interaction, connecting billions of people around the world and providing access to an unprecedented amount of information and resources. Its decentralised nature and open architecture have fostered innovation and the rapid development of new technologies and applications, transforming many aspects of modern life and contributing to the phenomenon of globalisation.

Causal relation: {Internet, Relative_Poverty} → stratifies → {Social_Inequality, Education}

Semantical explanation of relative_Poverty_ID000001: 
Relative poverty refers to a floating standard of deprivation by which people at the bottom of a society, whatever their absolute lifestyles or level of material comfort, are judged to be disadvantaged and lacking in comparison with the overall standards and average lifestyle of the nation or society as a whole. This measure of poverty is not based on a fixed threshold of basic needs but rather on the relative economic position of individuals or households within their social context. It acknowledges that what is considered a minimally acceptable standard of living can vary across different societies and change over time, and that poverty is not just about lacking the bare necessities for survival but also about being excluded from the ordinary living patterns, customs, and amenities that are considered customary in the society in which one belongs.

Causal relation: {Internet, Relative_Poverty} → stratifies → {Social_Inequality, Education}

Semantical explanation of social_Inequality_ID000004: 
Social inequality refers to a condition within a society in which its members have significantly different amounts of wealth, income, prestige, power, or other valued resources and opportunities. This unequal distribution can be based on various social categories such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability, often resulting in hierarchical arrangements where some groups have more access to resources and privileges than others. Social inequality is a fundamental topic of study in sociology, with researchers examining its causes, consequences, and the ways in which it is maintained and challenged over time. It can manifest in various forms, including economic disparities, differences in social status and respect, and unequal access to political influence and decision-making power.

Causal relation: {Internet, Relative_Poverty} → stratifies → {Social_Inequality, Education}

Semantical explanation of education_ID000002: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility. Sociologists study education to understand its impact on social inequality, its relationship to the economy, and its role in shaping individual identities and life chances.

Semantical explanation of cyberspace_ID000002: 
Cyberspace refers to electronic networks of interaction between individuals at different computer terminals, linking people at a level â€“ in a dimension â€“ that has no regard for territorial boundaries or physical presence. It is a virtual realm created by interconnected computer networks, primarily the internet, where individuals can communicate, interact, and exchange information regardless of their physical location. Cyberspace encompasses a wide range of online activities, including social networking, email communication, online shopping, virtual gaming, and accessing information through the World Wide Web. The nature of cyberspace allows for the formation of online communities based on shared interests, identities, or goals, transcending geographical limitations. This virtual environment has become an increasingly significant space for social interaction, economic activity, and cultural exchange in modern society. The lack of physical presence and territorial boundaries in cyberspace raises unique social, ethical, and legal challenges related to issues such as privacy, security, and governance.

Causal relation: {Discrimination, Segregation, Institutional_Discrimination} → marginalises → {Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of discrimination_ID000001: 
Discrimination is the process of denying opportunities and equal rights to individuals and groups because of prejudice or other arbitrary reasons, often stemming from negative stereotypes and biases. This can manifest in various forms, including individual acts of prejudice and systemic or institutional discrimination embedded in policies and practices. Discrimination can target individuals based on a wide range of characteristics, such as age, sex, nationality, religion, skin color, disability, or physical appearance. It involves treating people unfairly or unequally due to their membership in a particular group, rather than based on their individual merits or abilities. The consequences of discrimination can be significant, leading to social exclusion, economic disadvantage, limited access to resources, and psychological harm for those who experience it. While overt forms of discrimination are often condemned, more subtle or indirect forms can persist and continue to perpetuate inequalities within society. Addressing discrimination requires not only legal and policy measures but also efforts to challenge underlying prejudices and stereotypes through education and awareness. The impact of discrimination can be particularly pronounced when individuals face multiple forms of discrimination based on intersecting aspects of their identity, such as age combined with gender, race, or disability.

Causal relation: {Discrimination, Segregation, Institutional_Discrimination} → marginalises → {Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of segregation_ID000001: 
Segregation refers to the act and process of physically, socially, or legally separating two or more groups of people, often based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or socioeconomic status. While segregation can occur in various forms, it is frequently imposed on a minority group by a dominant group within a society, leading to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social institutions such as housing, education, healthcare, and employment. Segregation can be enforced through explicit laws and policies (de jure segregation) or through informal social norms and practices (de facto segregation). It often results in social isolation, limited intergroup contact, and the perpetuation of inequalities between the separated groups. The history of segregation in various parts of the world, such as racial segregation in the United States and apartheid in South Africa, demonstrates its profound and lasting negative impacts on marginalised groups and society as a whole.

Causal relation: {Discrimination, Segregation, Institutional_Discrimination} → marginalises → {Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of institutional_Discrimination_ID000001: 
Institutional discrimination refers to the denial of opportunities and equal rights to individuals and groups that results from the normal operations of a society's institutions, such as schools, workplaces, healthcare systems, and the legal system, rather than from overt acts of individual prejudice. This form of discrimination is often embedded in established policies, procedures, and practices that may appear neutral on the surface but systematically disadvantage certain groups based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. For example, standardised testing in education that is culturally biased may disproportionately disadvantage students from certain minority groups, limiting their access to higher education. Similarly, hiring practices that rely heavily on personal networks may exclude qualified candidates who lack connections to the dominant group within an industry. Institutional discrimination can be subtle and often unintentional, but its cumulative effect can be significant in perpetuating social inequalities.

Causal relation: {Discrimination, Segregation, Institutional_Discrimination} → marginalises → {Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of minority_Group_ID000002: 
A minority group is a group of people in a minority in a given society who, because of their distinct physical or cultural characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability, find themselves in situations of inequality or disadvantage within that society. Membership in a minority group is typically ascribed rather than achieved, and these groups often experience discrimination, prejudice, and limited access to power and resources compared to the dominant or majority group. The term "minority" in this sociological context does not necessarily refer to a group's numerical size but rather to its subordinate status and lack of social, economic, and political power. Minority groups often develop a strong sense of group solidarity and shared identity in response to their experiences of marginalisation.

Semantical explanation of capitalism_ID000006: 
Capitalism is a system of economic enterprise based on market exchange, private ownership of the means of production, and the pursuit of profit. 'Capital' refers to any asset, including money, property, and machines, which can be used to produce commodities for sale or invested in a market with the hope of achieving a profit. Key features of capitalism include free markets, competition, wage labor, and the accumulation of capital. While it can drive innovation and economic growth, capitalism has also been criticised for its potential to create social inequalities and economic instability. Karl Marx argued that capitalism leads to alienation of workers from their labor and the products they produce.

Semantical explanation of economic_System_ID000004: 
An economic system is the social institution through which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed within a society. It encompasses the organisational arrangements, rules, and practices that govern how a society allocates its resources to satisfy the needs and wants of its members. Different societies have adopted various types of economic systems throughout history, including traditional economies, command economies, market economies (capitalism), and mixed economies that combine elements of different systems. Each type of economic system has its own set of principles regarding ownership of resources, decision-making processes, and mechanisms for production, distribution, and consumption. The dominant economic system in a society has a profound impact on its social structure, levels of inequality, and the daily lives of its people.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Economic_System} → stratifies → {Social_Class, Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000002: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Economic_System} → stratifies → {Social_Class, Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of social_Stratification_ID000002: 
Social stratification refers to the existence of structured inequalities between different groups in society in terms of their access to material or symbolic rewards, such as wealth, income, prestige, power, status, and opportunities. While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, significant and enduring patterns of inequality, leading to hierarchical arrangements of social groups, tend to arise with the development of more complex, state-based systems. The most distinctive and extensively studied form of stratification in modern societies involves class divisions, based primarily on economic factors, but stratification can also occur along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and other social categories. Sociologists examine the causes and consequences of social stratification, as well as the processes that maintain or challenge these inequalities over time.

Semantical explanation of economy_ID000002: 
The economy refers to the system of production and exchange which provides for the material needs of individuals living in a given society. It encompasses all activities related to the creation, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The economy is a fundamental aspect of social life, as it shapes how people earn a living, access resources, and interact with one another in the process of fulfilling their material needs and wants. The structure and functioning of the economy are influenced by a complex interplay of social, cultural, political, and technological factors. Sociologists study the economy to understand its impact on social inequality, social mobility, work, and other aspects of social life. Different types of economies, such as agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial economies, have distinct characteristics and social consequences.

Causal relation: {Economic_System} → coordinates → {Economy, Economic_Interdependence}

Semantical explanation of economic_Interdependence_ID000001: 
Economic interdependence is the outcome of specialisation and the division of labor, where self-sufficiency is superseded and individuals, regions, or nations depend on others to produce many or most of the goods and services they need to sustain their lives. This interconnectedness arises when different entities focus on producing specific goods or services more efficiently than others and then trade with each other to meet their diverse needs and wants. Economic interdependence can lead to increased efficiency, productivity, and overall economic growth by allowing for specialisation and economies of scale. However, it also means that disruptions in one part of the interdependent system can have ripple effects across other parts, creating vulnerabilities to economic shocks and global events. The rise of globalisation has significantly increased economic interdependence between countries, making national economies more reliant on international trade and financial flows.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Means_Of_Production} → exploits → {Proletariat, Bourgeoisie}

Semantical explanation of means_Of_Production_ID000002: 
The means of production, a core concept in Marxist theory, refers to the resources, tools, technologies, land, factories, and other infrastructure whereby the production of material goods is carried on in a society. This concept encompasses not just the physical technology involved in production but also the social relations between the producers (e.g., the relationship between the owners of the means of production and the workers who use them). According to Marx, the ownership and control of the means of production are central to understanding the structure of society and the distribution of power and wealth. In capitalist societies, the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) owns and controls the means of production, while the proletariat (working class) must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie to survive, leading to inherent inequalities and class conflict.

Semantical explanation of proletariat_ID000003: 
Proletariat, in the theoretical framework of Karl Marx, refers to the working class in a capitalist society who do not own the means of production (such as factories, land, and capital) and must therefore sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class who own the means of production) in order to earn a living and survive. According to Marx, the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie, who extract surplus value from their labor in the form of profit, leading to inherent class conflict and the potential for the proletariat to develop class consciousness and ultimately overthrow the capitalist system.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Means_Of_Production} → exploits → {Proletariat, Bourgeoisie}

Semantical explanation of bourgeoisie_ID000003: 
Bourgeoisie, in the theory of Karl Marx, refers to the capitalist class, comprising the owners of the means of production, such as factories, land, and capital. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie stands in opposition to the proletariat, or working class, who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie in order to survive.[1, 2] According to Marx, the bourgeoisie's primary goal is the accumulation of capital and profit, which they achieve through the exploitation of the proletariat. This class structure and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are central to Marx's critique of capitalism.

Semantical explanation of economic_System_ID000006: 
An economic system is the social institution through which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed within a society. It encompasses the organisational arrangements, rules, and practices that govern how a society allocates its resources to satisfy the needs and wants of its members. Different societies have adopted various types of economic systems throughout history, including traditional economies, command economies, market economies (capitalism), and mixed economies that combine elements of different systems. Each type of economic system has its own set of principles regarding ownership of resources, decision-making processes, and mechanisms for production, distribution, and consumption. The dominant economic system in a society has a profound impact on its social structure, levels of inequality, and the daily lives of its people.

Causal relation: {Economic_System, Outsourcing} → causallyInfluencedBy → {Migration, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of outsourcing_ID000001: 
Outsourcing is the business practice of contracting out a company's work tasks, functions, or processes to external third-party providers or service providers, which were previously carried out internally by the company's own employees. Companies may choose to outsource for various reasons, such as to reduce costs, improve efficiency, access specialised skills or technologies, or focus on their core business activities. Outsourcing can involve a wide range of functions, including manufacturing, information technology services, customer support, human resources, and accounting. While it can offer benefits to companies, outsourcing can also have implications for the company's employees, potentially leading to job losses or changes in working conditions, and can also raise ethical considerations related to labor practices and quality control in the outsourced operations.

Causal relation: {Economic_System, Outsourcing} → causallyInfluencedBy → {Migration, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of migration_ID000001: 
Migration refers to the movement of people into and out of a particular territory, which can occur within a country (internal migration) or across national borders (international migration). This movement can be temporary or permanent and can be driven by a variety of factors, including economic opportunities, political instability, environmental changes, social networks, and personal aspirations. Immigration involves the movement of people into a new country to settle, while emigration refers to the movement of people out of a country to live elsewhere. Migration patterns can have significant demographic, economic, social, and cultural impacts on both the areas of origin and the areas of destination, influencing population size and composition, labor markets, cultural diversity, and social integration. Sociologists study migration to understand its causes and consequences, the experiences of migrants, and the policies and social responses to migration flows.

Causal relation: {Economic_System, Outsourcing} → causallyInfluencedBy → {Migration, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of social_Inequality_ID000005: 
Social inequality refers to a condition within a society in which its members have significantly different amounts of wealth, income, prestige, power, or other valued resources and opportunities. This unequal distribution can be based on various social categories such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability, often resulting in hierarchical arrangements where some groups have more access to resources and privileges than others. Social inequality is a fundamental topic of study in sociology, with researchers examining its causes, consequences, and the ways in which it is maintained and challenged over time. It can manifest in various forms, including economic disparities, differences in social status and respect, and unequal access to political influence and decision-making power.

Causal relation: {Economic_System, Economic_Interdependence} → influencesHistorically → {Migration, Cultural_Diversity}

Semantical explanation of economic_Interdependence_ID000002: 
Economic interdependence is the outcome of specialisation and the division of labor, where self-sufficiency is superseded and individuals, regions, or nations depend on others to produce many or most of the goods and services they need to sustain their lives. This interconnectedness arises when different entities focus on producing specific goods or services more efficiently than others and then trade with each other to meet their diverse needs and wants. Economic interdependence can lead to increased efficiency, productivity, and overall economic growth by allowing for specialisation and economies of scale. However, it also means that disruptions in one part of the interdependent system can have ripple effects across other parts, creating vulnerabilities to economic shocks and global events. The rise of globalisation has significantly increased economic interdependence between countries, making national economies more reliant on international trade and financial flows.

Causal relation: {Economic_System, Economic_Interdependence} → influencesHistorically → {Migration, Cultural_Diversity}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Diversity_ID000001: 
Cultural Diversity refers to the variety and richness of different cultures, subcultures, and ethnic groups that coexist within a given society or across the globe. It encompasses the wide array of unique values, norms, beliefs, languages, customs, traditions, social practices, and forms of expression that distinguish these groups from one another. This diversity contributes to the multifaceted nature of human society, reflecting the myriad ways in which people organise their lives, understand the world, and express themselves. Cultural diversity is often celebrated for enriching society by fostering innovation, creativity, a broader range of perspectives, and a more vibrant cultural landscape, thereby enhancing cultural vitality and mutual understanding. However, it can also present challenges related to social cohesion, intergroup relations, and potential conflicts arising from differing values, competing interests, or the historical legacies of power imbalances and discrimination. Sociologists study cultural diversity to understand how different groups maintain their distinct identities while interacting within a larger social framework, and how societies manage diversity to promote inclusion, equality, and social harmony, moving beyond assimilationist models towards valuing cultural pluralism and multiculturalism, and addressing issues like prejudice and segregation.

Capitalists are those who own companies, land, or stocks and shares, using these assets to generate economic returns or profits through investment and production. In a capitalist system, capitalists control the means of production and employ workers to produce goods and services, aiming to maximise their profits. They play a central role in the economy by investing capital and taking risks in the pursuit of economic growth. The relationship between capitalists and workers is often characterised by an imbalance of power, as capitalists own the resources necessary for production and workers depend on them for employment and wages.

Bourgeoisie, in the theory of Karl Marx, refers to the capitalist class, comprising the owners of the means of production, such as factories, land, and capital. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie stands in opposition to the proletariat, or working class, who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie in order to survive.[1, 2] According to Marx, the bourgeoisie's primary goal is the accumulation of capital and profit, which they achieve through the exploitation of the proletariat. This class structure and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are central to Marx's critique of capitalism.

Causal relation: {Capitalists, Bourgeoisie} → exploits → {Surplus_Value, Proletariat}

Semantical explanation of surplus_Value_ID000001: 
In Marxist economic theory, surplus value is the difference between the value of the goods or services produced by a worker's labor power and the wages the employer pays for that labor power; it is the value of the worker's labor that is 'left over' after the employer has covered all the costs involved in hiring the worker, including wages and the costs of production. According to Marx, this surplus value is the source of capitalist profit and represents the exploitation of the proletariat (working class) by the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) because the workers do not receive the full value of what they produce; instead, the surplus is appropriated by the capitalists who own the means of production. The extraction of surplus value is seen by Marx as a fundamental characteristic of capitalism and a key driver of the inherent conflict between the interests of capitalists and workers.

Semantical explanation of proletariat_ID000004: 
Proletariat, in the theoretical framework of Karl Marx, refers to the working class in a capitalist society who do not own the means of production (such as factories, land, and capital) and must therefore sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class who own the means of production) in order to earn a living and survive. According to Marx, the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie, who extract surplus value from their labor in the form of profit, leading to inherent class conflict and the potential for the proletariat to develop class consciousness and ultimately overthrow the capitalist system.

Causal relation: {Neoliberalism, Deindustrialisation} → marginalises → {Underground_Economy, Underclass}

Semantical explanation of neoliberalism_ID000001: 
Neoliberalism is a dominant economic belief system and political ideology that advocates for free market forces as the primary route to economic growth and prosperity, achieved by minimizing government restrictions and interventions on business and the economy. Key tenets of neoliberalism include deregulation, privatisation of state-owned enterprises, reduced government spending on social programs, free trade, and fiscal austerity. This ideology gained prominence in the late 20th century and has influenced economic policies in many countries around the world, often leading to increased globalisation and a greater role for the private sector in the economy. While proponents argue that neoliberal policies promote efficiency, innovation, and economic growth, critics point to potential negative consequences such as increased income inequality, social instability, and environmental degradation due to the prioritisation of market forces over social and environmental concerns.

Causal relation: {Neoliberalism, Deindustrialisation} → marginalises → {Underground_Economy, Underclass}

Semantical explanation of deindustrialisation_ID000002: 
Deindustrialisation is the systematic, widespread withdrawal of investment in basic aspects of productivity such as factories and plants, leading to a decline in manufacturing and industrial activity in a region or country. This process is often accompanied by a shift towards a service-based economy, with a greater emphasis on sectors like finance, information technology, and healthcare. Deindustrialisation can be caused by various factors, including technological advancements that automate production, the globalisation of manufacturing leading to production moving to countries with lower labor costs, and a shift in consumer demand towards services rather than manufactured goods. While deindustrialisation can lead to economic restructuring and the emergence of new industries, it can also result in job losses in the manufacturing sector, economic hardship for affected communities, and increased social inequality if new opportunities are not readily available or accessible to all. The social and economic consequences of deindustrialisation have been a significant area of study in sociology, with researchers examining its impact on employment, social class, and community well-being.

Causal relation: {Neoliberalism, Deindustrialisation} → marginalises → {Underground_Economy, Underclass}

Semantical explanation of underground_Economy_ID000001: 
The underground economy, also known as the shadow economy or informal economy, refers to economic activity that generates income but is unreported to the government as required by law, often to avoid taxation or regulation. This can include a wide range of activities, both legal and illegal, such as undeclared cash transactions, off-the-books employment, informal services, the sale of illegal goods, and other economic exchanges that take place outside the formal, regulated sector of the economy. The size and nature of the underground economy can vary significantly across different countries and regions, influenced by factors such as tax rates, regulatory burdens, levels of corruption, and the availability of formal employment opportunities. While it can provide income for individuals who may be excluded from the formal economy, it also has implications for government revenue, economic statistics, and social protections for workers involved in these activities.

Causal relation: {Neoliberalism, Deindustrialisation} → marginalises → {Underground_Economy, Underclass}

Semantical explanation of underclass_ID000001: 
The underclass is a term used in sociology to describe a group of people who are considered to be 'under' or outside the traditional class structure of society, often characterised by chronic poverty, long-term unemployment or underemployment, social isolation, and economic, political, and social marginalisation and exclusion. Members of the underclass may experience multiple and overlapping forms of disadvantage, including limited access to education, healthcare, stable housing, and social support networks, often leading to a cycle of poverty that is difficult to escape. The concept of the underclass is often associated with inner-city areas and may be linked to factors such as deindustrialisation, lack of job opportunities, and systemic discrimination. There is ongoing debate among sociologists about the definition, causes, and consequences of the underclass, as well as the most effective ways to address the complex issues of poverty and social exclusion that affect this group.

Semantical explanation of multinational_Corporations_ID000003: 
Multinational corporations (MNCs) are large commercial organisations that are headquartered in one country (the home country) but conduct business operations, including production, marketing, sales, and research and development, in numerous other countries around the world (host countries). These corporations often have significant economic power and play a major role in the global economy through foreign direct investment, international trade, and the transfer of technology and capital across borders. MNCs can have both positive and negative impacts on the countries in which they operate, providing jobs and investment but also potentially raising issues related to labor practices, environmental regulations, and economic sovereignty. The study of multinational corporations is an important area in sociology, particularly in the context of globalisation and its effects on national economies and societies.

Semantical explanation of capitalism_ID000008: 
Capitalism is a system of economic enterprise based on market exchange, private ownership of the means of production, and the pursuit of profit. 'Capital' refers to any asset, including money, property, and machines, which can be used to produce commodities for sale or invested in a market with the hope of achieving a profit. Key features of capitalism include free markets, competition, wage labor, and the accumulation of capital. While it can drive innovation and economic growth, capitalism has also been criticised for its potential to create social inequalities and economic instability. Karl Marx argued that capitalism leads to alienation of workers from their labor and the products they produce.

Semantical explanation of economy_ID000003: 
The economy refers to the system of production and exchange which provides for the material needs of individuals living in a given society. It encompasses all activities related to the creation, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The economy is a fundamental aspect of social life, as it shapes how people earn a living, access resources, and interact with one another in the process of fulfilling their material needs and wants. The structure and functioning of the economy are influenced by a complex interplay of social, cultural, political, and technological factors. Sociologists study the economy to understand its impact on social inequality, social mobility, work, and other aspects of social life. Different types of economies, such as agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial economies, have distinct characteristics and social consequences.

Causal relation: {Multinational_Corporations, Capitalism} → competesWith → {Economy, Economic_Interdependence}

Semantical explanation of economic_Interdependence_ID000003: 
Economic interdependence is the outcome of specialisation and the division of labor, where self-sufficiency is superseded and individuals, regions, or nations depend on others to produce many or most of the goods and services they need to sustain their lives. This interconnectedness arises when different entities focus on producing specific goods or services more efficiently than others and then trade with each other to meet their diverse needs and wants. Economic interdependence can lead to increased efficiency, productivity, and overall economic growth by allowing for specialisation and economies of scale. However, it also means that disruptions in one part of the interdependent system can have ripple effects across other parts, creating vulnerabilities to economic shocks and global events. The rise of globalisation has significantly increased economic interdependence between countries, making national economies more reliant on international trade and financial flows.

Causal relation: {Monopoly, Multinational_Corporations} → controls → {Economy, Economic_System}

Semantical explanation of monopoly_ID000002: 
Monopoly refers to the control of a particular market or industry by a single business firm, giving that firm the power to dominate the market without significant competition. In a monopoly, the single firm is the sole producer or seller of a specific product or service, allowing it to set prices, control supply, and potentially limit consumer choice. This lack of competition can lead to higher prices, lower quality, and reduced innovation compared to markets with multiple competing firms. Monopolies can arise due to various factors, such as government regulations granting exclusive rights, the control of essential resources, high barriers to entry that prevent new firms from competing, or network effects where the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. While some monopolies may be considered natural due to inherent efficiencies of scale in certain industries, they are often subject to government regulation and antitrust laws aimed at preventing unfair competition and protecting consumer interests. The existence of a monopoly can have significant implications for the economy and society, affecting market dynamics, consumer welfare, and the distribution of wealth.

Causal relation: {Monopoly, Multinational_Corporations} → controls → {Economy, Economic_System}

Semantical explanation of multinational_Corporations_ID000004: 
Multinational corporations (MNCs) are large commercial organisations that are headquartered in one country (the home country) but conduct business operations, including production, marketing, sales, and research and development, in numerous other countries around the world (host countries). These corporations often have significant economic power and play a major role in the global economy through foreign direct investment, international trade, and the transfer of technology and capital across borders. MNCs can have both positive and negative impacts on the countries in which they operate, providing jobs and investment but also potentially raising issues related to labor practices, environmental regulations, and economic sovereignty. The study of multinational corporations is an important area in sociology, particularly in the context of globalisation and its effects on national economies and societies.

Causal relation: {Monopoly, Multinational_Corporations} → controls → {Economy, Economic_System}

Semantical explanation of economy_ID000004: 
The economy refers to the system of production and exchange which provides for the material needs of individuals living in a given society. It encompasses all activities related to the creation, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The economy is a fundamental aspect of social life, as it shapes how people earn a living, access resources, and interact with one another in the process of fulfilling their material needs and wants. The structure and functioning of the economy are influenced by a complex interplay of social, cultural, political, and technological factors. Sociologists study the economy to understand its impact on social inequality, social mobility, work, and other aspects of social life. Different types of economies, such as agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial economies, have distinct characteristics and social consequences.

Causal relation: {Monopoly, Multinational_Corporations} → controls → {Economy, Economic_System}

Semantical explanation of economic_System_ID000008: 
An economic system is the social institution through which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed within a society. It encompasses the organisational arrangements, rules, and practices that govern how a society allocates its resources to satisfy the needs and wants of its members. Different societies have adopted various types of economic systems throughout history, including traditional economies, command economies, market economies (capitalism), and mixed economies that combine elements of different systems. Each type of economic system has its own set of principles regarding ownership of resources, decision-making processes, and mechanisms for production, distribution, and consumption. The dominant economic system in a society has a profound impact on its social structure, levels of inequality, and the daily lives of its people.

Semantical explanation of capitalism_ID000009: 
Capitalism is a system of economic enterprise based on market exchange, private ownership of the means of production, and the pursuit of profit. 'Capital' refers to any asset, including money, property, and machines, which can be used to produce commodities for sale or invested in a market with the hope of achieving a profit. Key features of capitalism include free markets, competition, wage labor, and the accumulation of capital. While it can drive innovation and economic growth, capitalism has also been criticised for its potential to create social inequalities and economic instability. Karl Marx argued that capitalism leads to alienation of workers from their labor and the products they produce.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Class_System} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of class_System_ID000001: 
A class system is a form of social ranking based primarily on economic position in which achieved characteristics can influence mobility. Unlike caste systems, where social position is ascribed at birth and cannot be changed, class systems allow for social mobility, the movement of individuals or groups up or down the social hierarchy, based on factors such as education, occupation, and income (achieved characteristics). While economic factors are central to class systems, social status and power also play a role. Class systems are characteristic of modern industrial societies and are considered more open than caste systems, although the extent of social mobility can vary significantly. Sociologists often study class systems to understand patterns of inequality and the factors that influence social mobility.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Class_System} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of social_Stratification_ID000003: 
Social stratification refers to the existence of structured inequalities between different groups in society in terms of their access to material or symbolic rewards, such as wealth, income, prestige, power, status, and opportunities. While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, significant and enduring patterns of inequality, leading to hierarchical arrangements of social groups, tend to arise with the development of more complex, state-based systems. The most distinctive and extensively studied form of stratification in modern societies involves class divisions, based primarily on economic factors, but stratification can also occur along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and other social categories. Sociologists examine the causes and consequences of social stratification, as well as the processes that maintain or challenge these inequalities over time.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Class_System} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of social_Inequality_ID000006: 
Social inequality refers to a condition within a society in which its members have significantly different amounts of wealth, income, prestige, power, or other valued resources and opportunities. This unequal distribution can be based on various social categories such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability, often resulting in hierarchical arrangements where some groups have more access to resources and privileges than others. Social inequality is a fundamental topic of study in sociology, with researchers examining its causes, consequences, and the ways in which it is maintained and challenged over time. It can manifest in various forms, including economic disparities, differences in social status and respect, and unequal access to political influence and decision-making power.

Semantical explanation of education_ID000003: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility. Sociologists study education to understand its impact on social inequality, its relationship to the economy, and its role in shaping individual identities and life chances.

Causal relation: {Education} → educates → {Social_Mobility}

Semantical explanation of social_Mobility_ID000003: 
Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals or groups from one position to another within a society's stratification system, which is the hierarchical arrangement of social positions based on factors like wealth, income, occupation, education, and social status. This movement can be upward, representing an improvement in social standing (e.g., moving from a working-class job to a professional occupation), or downward, indicating a decline in social position (e.g., due to unemployment or business failure). Social mobility can occur within an individual's lifetime (intragenerational mobility) or across generations (intergenerational mobility, comparing the social position of children to that of their parents). The degree of social mobility in a society is often seen as an indicator of its openness and the extent to which individuals can change their social standing based on their achievements and efforts rather than being limited by their ascribed status at birth.

Semantical explanation of education_ID000004: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility. Sociologists study education to understand its impact on social inequality, its relationship to the economy, and its role in shaping individual identities and life chances.

Semantical explanation of socialisation_ID000001: 
Socialisation refers to the lifelong social processes through which individuals develop an awareness of social norms, values, beliefs, and behaviours of their culture and society, and achieve a distinct sense of self and identity. This process begins in early childhood with primary socialisation within the family, where children learn basic language, social skills, and cultural norms from parents and close relatives. As individuals grow, they continue to be socialised through secondary agents such as schools, peer groups, the media, religion, and the workplace, learning the more specific roles, expectations, and behaviours associated with different social contexts and stages of life. Socialisation is crucial for individuals to become integrated members of their society and for the transmission of culture across generations.

Causal relation: {Education, Hidden_Curriculum} → reproduces → {Cultural_Reproduction, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of hidden_Curriculum_ID000001: 
The hidden curriculum refers to the unstated or subtle standards of behaviour, attitudes, values, and beliefs that are deemed proper by society and are taught implicitly in schools through the everyday practices, routines, and social interactions within the educational environment, rather than through the formal academic curriculum. This can include learning about punctuality, obedience to authority, competition, conformity to rules, and the importance of social hierarchies. The hidden curriculum plays a significant role in the socialisation of students, shaping their understanding of social norms, expectations, and power dynamics in ways that may not be explicitly stated but are nonetheless influential in preparing them for their roles in the broader society and the workplace. Sociologists study the hidden curriculum to understand how schools contribute to the reproduction of social inequalities and the transmission of dominant cultural values.

Causal relation: {Education, Hidden_Curriculum} → reproduces → {Cultural_Reproduction, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Reproduction_ID000001: 
Cultural reproduction refers to the process by which a society transmits dominant knowledge, values, beliefs, and social inequalities from one generation to another. This transmission occurs through various social institutions, including the family, education system, media, and religion. Cultural reproduction theory, particularly associated with the work of Pierre Bourdieu and Basil Bernstein, highlights how the dominant culture in a society tends to be perpetuated, often reinforcing existing power structures and social hierarchies. For example, the education system may prioritise certain forms of knowledge and cultural capital that are more readily accessible to children from privileged backgrounds, thereby contributing to their continued success and the reproduction of social class differences across generations. Similarly, the media can play a role in shaping and reinforcing dominant ideologies and cultural norms. Understanding cultural reproduction helps sociologists analyse how social inequalities are maintained and transmitted over time, even in the absence of overt discrimination.

Causal relation: {Education, Hidden_Curriculum} → reproduces → {Cultural_Reproduction, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000003: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

A family is a group of individuals related to one another by blood ties, marriage, or adoption who form an economic unit, the adult members of which are responsible for the upbringing of children. All known societies involve some form of family system, although the nature of family relationships is widely variable across cultures and throughout history. While in modern societies the main family form is often considered the nuclear family (a couple and their dependent children), a variety of extended family relationships (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) are also frequently found and play important roles in individuals' lives. The family serves as a primary agent of socialisation, providing emotional support, care, and a sense of belonging for its members. It also plays a crucial role in the transmission of cultural norms, values, and traditions across generations.

Semantical explanation of education_ID000007: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility.

Causal relation: {Education, Tracking} → stratifies → {Social_Class, Social_Mobility}

Semantical explanation of tracking_ID000001: 
Tracking, in the context of education, is the practice of placing students in specific curriculum groups or academic programs within a school system based on their perceived academic abilities, which are often assessed through standardised test scores, prior academic performance, or teacher recommendations. This practice can result in students being separated into different tracks, such as "high-achieving," "average," or "low-achieving," which may offer different levels of academic rigor, resources, and future opportunities. While proponents argue that tracking allows teachers to tailor instruction to the specific needs of students at different academic levels, critics raise concerns about its potential to perpetuate social inequalities, as students from disadvantaged backgrounds may be disproportionately placed in lower tracks, limiting their educational attainment and future prospects, while those in higher tracks often receive more enriched learning experiences and better preparation for college. The effects of tracking on student achievement and social equity remain a subject of ongoing debate in educational sociology.

Causal relation: {Education, Tracking} → stratifies → {Social_Class, Social_Mobility}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000004: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Education, Tracking} → stratifies → {Social_Class, Social_Mobility}

Semantical explanation of social_Mobility_ID000004: 
Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals or groups from one position to another within a society's stratification system, which is the hierarchical arrangement of social positions based on factors like wealth, income, occupation, education, and social status. This movement can be upward, representing an improvement in social standing (e.g., moving from a working-class job to a professional occupation), or downward, indicating a decline in social position (e.g., due to unemployment or business failure). Social mobility can occur within an individual's lifetime (intragenerational mobility) or across generations (intergenerational mobility, comparing the social position of children to that of their parents). The degree of social mobility in a society is often seen as an indicator of its openness and the extent to which individuals can change their social standing based on their achievements and efforts rather than being limited by their ascribed status at birth.

Causal relation: {Education, Cultural_Capital} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Class_System}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Capital_ID000004: 
Cultural capital, a concept developed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, refers to the types of knowledge, skills, education, and other cultural resources that confer advantages on those who acquire them, providing them with social mobility and status within a society. Bourdieu identified three forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalised. Embodied cultural capital exists in the form of knowledge and skills that are consciously acquired and passively inherited, such as language proficiency, manners, tastes, and dispositions. These are often learned through socialisation within a particular social class or cultural environment. Objectified cultural capital refers to cultural goods such as books, artworks, musical instruments, and other material objects that can be owned and transmitted. However, the possession of these objects is not sufficient; one must also have the cultural competence to understand and appreciate them to fully benefit from this form of capital. Institutionalised cultural capital consists of academic credentials, professional qualifications, and other forms of formal recognition that legitimate an individual's cultural competence and confer social advantages in the labor market and other social institutions. Cultural capital plays a significant role in social reproduction, as individuals from privileged backgrounds often possess more cultural capital, which helps them succeed in educational systems and gain access to higher-status occupations, thereby perpetuating social inequalities across generations.

Causal relation: {Education, Cultural_Capital} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Class_System}

Semantical explanation of social_Stratification_ID000004: 
Social stratification refers to the existence of structured inequalities between different groups in society in terms of their access to material or symbolic rewards, such as wealth, income, prestige, power, status, and opportunities. While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, significant and enduring patterns of inequality, leading to hierarchical arrangements of social groups, tend to arise with the development of more complex, state-based systems. The most distinctive and extensively studied form of stratification in modern societies involves class divisions, based primarily on economic factors, but stratification can also occur along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and other social categories. Sociologists examine the causes and consequences of social stratification, as well as the processes that maintain or challenge these inequalities over time.

Causal relation: {Education, Cultural_Capital} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Class_System}

Semantical explanation of class_System_ID000002: 
A class system is a form of social ranking based primarily on economic position in which achieved characteristics can influence mobility. Unlike caste systems, where social position is ascribed at birth and cannot be changed, class systems allow for social mobility, the movement of individuals or groups up or down the social hierarchy, based on factors such as education, occupation, and income (achieved characteristics). While economic factors are central to class systems, social status and power also play a role. Class systems are characteristic of modern industrial societies and are considered more open than caste systems, although the extent of social mobility can vary significantly. Sociologists often study class systems to understand patterns of inequality and the factors that influence social mobility.

Semantical explanation of achieved_Status_ID000001: 
Achieved status refers to a social position that a person attains largely through their own efforts, skills, abilities, and choices. It is earned or chosen based on merit and reflects personal accomplishments. Examples include becoming an Olympic medalist, a college graduate, a technical professional, or even a criminal. This is in contrast to ascribed status, which is assigned at birth or is beyond an individual's control, such as race or sex. Achieved status comes with associated rights, obligations, behaviours, and duties expected of those in that position, known as roles. While ideally based on merit, the ability to achieve certain statuses can be influenced by ascribed statuses and cultural capital. Achieved status plays a significant role in open societies where social mobility, the ability to move up or down the social hierarchy, is possible.

Semantical explanation of class_Consciousness_ID000001: 
In Karl Marx's view, class consciousness is a subjective awareness held by members of a class regarding their common vested interests and need for collective political action to bring about social change. Marx argued that for the proletariat (working class) to overcome their exploitation by the bourgeoisie (capitalist class), they needed to develop an understanding of their shared economic situation and their common interests in challenging the capitalist system. This awareness would then lead to collective action, such as organizing into labor unions and engaging in political struggle, to ultimately transform society and establish a communist system where the means of production are collectively owned. The development of class consciousness is a crucial step in Marx's theory of social change.

Semantical explanation of education_ID000010: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility. Sociologists study education to understand its impact on social inequality, its relationship to the economy, and its role in shaping individual identities and life chances.

Causal relation: {Education, Cultural_Capital} → educates → {Social_Mobility, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Capital_ID000005: 
Cultural capital, a concept developed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, refers to the types of knowledge, skills, education, and other cultural resources that confer advantages on those who acquire them, providing them with social mobility and status within a society. Bourdieu identified three forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalised. Embodied cultural capital exists in the form of knowledge and skills that are consciously acquired and passively inherited, such as language proficiency, manners, tastes, and dispositions. These are often learned through socialisation within a particular social class or cultural environment. Objectified cultural capital refers to cultural goods such as books, artworks, musical instruments, and other material objects that can be owned and transmitted. However, the possession of these objects is not sufficient; one must also have the cultural competence to understand and appreciate them to fully benefit from this form of capital. Institutionalised cultural capital consists of academic credentials, professional qualifications, and other forms of formal recognition that legitimate an individual's cultural competence and confer social advantages in the labor market and other social institutions. Cultural capital plays a significant role in social reproduction, as individuals from privileged backgrounds often possess more cultural capital, which helps them succeed in educational systems and gain access to higher-status occupations, thereby perpetuating social inequalities across generations.

Causal relation: {Education, Cultural_Capital} → educates → {Social_Mobility, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of social_Mobility_ID000006: 
Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals or groups from one position to another within a society's stratification system, which is the hierarchical arrangement of social positions based on factors like wealth, income, occupation, education, and social status. This movement can be upward, representing an improvement in social standing (e.g., moving from a working-class job to a professional occupation), or downward, indicating a decline in social position (e.g., due to unemployment or business failure). Social mobility can occur within an individual's lifetime (intragenerational mobility) or across generations (intergenerational mobility, comparing the social position of children to that of their parents). The degree of social mobility in a society is often seen as an indicator of its openness and the extent to which individuals can change their social standing based on their achievements and efforts rather than being limited by their ascribed status at birth.

Causal relation: {Education, Cultural_Capital} → educates → {Social_Mobility, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000005: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Tracking, Education} → segregates → {Segregation, Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of tracking_ID000002: 
Tracking, in the context of education, is the practice of placing students in specific curriculum groups or academic programs within a school system based on their perceived academic abilities, which are often assessed through standardised test scores, prior academic performance, or teacher recommendations. This practice can result in students being separated into different tracks, such as "high-achieving," "average," or "low-achieving," which may offer different levels of academic rigor, resources, and future opportunities. While proponents argue that tracking allows teachers to tailor instruction to the specific needs of students at different academic levels, critics raise concerns about its potential to perpetuate social inequalities, as students from disadvantaged backgrounds may be disproportionately placed in lower tracks, limiting their educational attainment and future prospects, while those in higher tracks often receive more enriched learning experiences and better preparation for college. The effects of tracking on student achievement and social equity remain a subject of ongoing debate in educational sociology.

Causal relation: {Tracking, Education} → segregates → {Segregation, Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of segregation_ID000002: 
Segregation refers to the act and process of physically, socially, or legally separating two or more groups of people, often based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or socioeconomic status. While segregation can occur in various forms, it is frequently imposed on a minority group by a dominant group within a society, leading to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social institutions such as housing, education, healthcare, and employment. Segregation can be enforced through explicit laws and policies (de jure segregation) or through informal social norms and practices (de facto segregation). It often results in social isolation, limited intergroup contact, and the perpetuation of inequalities between the separated groups. The history of segregation in various parts of the world, such as racial segregation in the United States and apartheid in South Africa, demonstrates its profound and lasting negative impacts on marginalised groups and society as a whole.

Causal relation: {Tracking, Education} → segregates → {Segregation, Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of social_Stratification_ID000005: 
Social stratification refers to the existence of structured inequalities between different groups in society in terms of their access to material or symbolic rewards, such as wealth, income, prestige, power, status, and opportunities. While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, significant and enduring patterns of inequality, leading to hierarchical arrangements of social groups, tend to arise with the development of more complex, state-based systems. The most distinctive and extensively studied form of stratification in modern societies involves class divisions, based primarily on economic factors, but stratification can also occur along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and other social categories. Sociologists examine the causes and consequences of social stratification, as well as the processes that maintain or challenge these inequalities over time.

Causal relation: {Elite_Model, Power_Elite} → controls → {Political_System, Mass_Media}

Semantical explanation of elite_Model_ID000001: 
The elite model is a view of society as ruled by a small group of individuals who share a common set of political and economic interests, effectively holding the majority of power and influence. This perspective suggests that despite the appearance of democracy, major decisions are made by a relatively cohesive group of elites who control key institutions, such as corporations, the government, and the military. These elites may come from similar social backgrounds, share similar values, and work to maintain their privileged positions and the existing social order. The elite model contrasts with the pluralist model, which argues that power is more widely distributed among various competing interest groups in society. Sociologists who subscribe to the elite model often study the social backgrounds, networks, and decision-making processes of those in power to understand how societal control is exercised.

Causal relation: {Elite_Model, Power_Elite} → controls → {Political_System, Mass_Media}

Semantical explanation of power_Elite_ID000002: 
Power elite is a term popularised by sociologist C. Wright Mills to describe a relatively small, tightly knit group of individuals who occupy the top positions in the dominant institutions of American societyâ€”namely, the military, the industrial (corporate) sector, and the governmentâ€”and who collectively hold the most power and make key decisions that shape the fate of the United States. According to Mills, these elites share similar backgrounds, interests, and worldviews, and their decisions have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the population, often operating outside of traditional democratic processes and accountability. The theory of the power elite suggests that power in modern industrial societies is concentrated rather than widely dispersed.

Semantical explanation of political_System_ID000002: 
A political system is the social institution within a society that relies on a recognised set of procedures and structures for implementing and achieving the collective goals of a group or society, particularly those related to power, authority, and governance. It encompasses the government, political parties, interest groups, and the broader political culture, including the norms, values, and beliefs that shape political behaviour and decision-making processes. The political system is responsible for making and enforcing rules, resolving conflicts, and allocating resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Elite_Model, Power_Elite} → controls → {Political_System, Mass_Media}

Semantical explanation of mass_Media_ID000002: 
Mass media refers to forms of communication, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television, films, and the internet, that are designed to reach and influence very large audiences, often simultaneously. These media play a significant role in shaping public opinion, disseminating information, transmitting cultural values and norms, and providing entertainment. The development and widespread availability of mass media have had a profound impact on society, influencing everything from political campaigns and consumer behaviour to popular culture and social movements. Sociologists study mass media to understand its effects on individuals and society, including issues related to media ownership, content, audience reception, and the role of media in shaping social identities and perceptions of reality. The rise of digital and social media has further transformed the landscape of mass communication, creating new opportunities and challenges for how information is produced, distributed, and consumed.

Causal relation: {Environmental_Sociology, Science} → mobilises → {Sustainable_Development, Natural_Environment}

Semantical explanation of environmental_Sociology_ID000001: 
Environmental Sociology is a specialised subfield within sociology that focuses on the complex and reciprocal interactions and relationships between human societies and the natural environment. It examines how social factors, such as economic systems, political structures, cultural values, and technological advancements, shape environmental conditions and problems (e.g., global warming, deforestation, desertification, pollution, resource depletion). Conversely, it also investigates how environmental changes and challenges impact human societies, influencing social inequalities, migration patterns, health outcomes, and social conflicts. Environmental sociologists analyse the social causes and consequences of environmental degradation, the social movements advocating for environmental protection and justice, and the development of environmental policies and sustainable practices. This field often highlights issues of environmental justice, which addresses the disproportionate exposure of marginalised communities to environmental hazards. It emphasises a critical and systemic approach to understanding the human-environment nexus in a globalised world, often drawing on concepts like risk society and manufactured risk.Aging_Studies = Aging Studies is an interdisciplinary academic field dedicated to the comprehensive examination of the multifaceted process of human aging and the experiences of older adults within societal contexts. This domain draws insights from sociology, psychology, biology, demography, public health, economics, and policy studies to understand the physiological, cognitive, emotional, and social changes that occur throughout the life course, particularly in later life. It focuses on the social roles older people occupy, the challenges they face (such as ageism, health disparities, and retirement transitions), and the diverse societal responses to an increasingly aging global population. Researchers in Aging Studies investigate topics like social support networks, elder care systems, generational relations, healthy aging initiatives, and the broader impact of demographic shifts on social institutions and resource allocation. The field also addresses the social construction of old age and the cultural perceptions of longevity, aiming to inform public policy and promote well-being, social inclusion, and equitable opportunities for individuals across all life stages within society. It is crucial for anticipating future societal needs.

Causal relation: {Environmental_Sociology, Science} → mobilises → {Sustainable_Development, Natural_Environment}

Semantical explanation of science_ID000001: 
Science is a systematic and logical system of acquiring knowledge about the natural and social world that bases its understanding on direct, systematic observation, empirical evidence, experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses and theories. It is characterised by its commitment to objectivity, empirical verification, and a self-correcting process where new evidence can lead to the revision or rejection of existing knowledge. The scientific method provides a structured approach to conducting research, ensuring rigor and minimizing bias in the pursuit of understanding how the world works. In sociology, science aims to apply these principles to the study of social behaviour, social structures, and social phenomena to develop reliable and valid knowledge about the social world.

Causal relation: {Environmental_Sociology, Science} → mobilises → {Sustainable_Development, Natural_Environment}

Semantical explanation of sustainable_Development_ID000001: 
Sustainable development is a concept and an approach to economic growth and social progress that emphasises the need to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is based on the principle that economic development should proceed in a way that natural resources are used responsibly and, where possible, recycled rather than depleted, biodiversity is maintained and protected, and clean air, water, and land are safeguarded for the long-term well-being of both human societies and the environment. Sustainable development seeks to integrate economic, social, and environmental considerations in decision-making, recognizing the interconnectedness of these dimensions and the importance of balancing them to achieve a more equitable and environmentally sound future for all.

Semantical explanation of natural_Environment_ID000001: 
The natural environment encompasses the Earth's surface and atmosphere, including all living organisms (plants, animals, microorganisms) as well as the non-living components such as the air, water, soil, rocks, and other resources that are necessary to sustain life and ecological systems. It represents the part of the environment that is not directly created or significantly altered by human activities, although human actions increasingly have a global impact on natural environments. The study of the natural environment is crucial for understanding ecological processes, biodiversity, and the interactions between living organisms and their surroundings. It is also essential for addressing environmental challenges such as pollution, resource depletion, and climate change, which have significant social and ecological consequences.

Semantical explanation of innovation_ID000004: 
Innovation is the process of introducing new elements, ideas, methods, or products into a culture or society, leading to change and often improvement. This can occur through two primary mechanisms: discovery and invention. Discovery involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown or unrecognised, such as a new scientific fact or a previously unknown natural resource. Invention, on the other hand, involves creating something entirely new that did not exist before, such as a new technology, a new tool, or a new process. Both discovery and invention can have profound impacts on a culture, leading to new practices, beliefs, social structures, and material advancements. The rate and nature of innovation can vary significantly across different societies and historical periods, influenced by factors such as technological development, cultural values, and social organisation.

An economic system is the social institution through which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed within a society. It encompasses the organisational arrangements, rules, and practices that govern how a society allocates its resources to satisfy the needs and wants of its members. Different societies have adopted various types of economic systems throughout history, including traditional economies, command economies, market economies (capitalism), and mixed economies that combine elements of different systems. Each type of economic system has its own set of principles regarding ownership of resources, decision-making processes, and mechanisms for production, distribution, and consumption. The dominant economic system in a society has a profound impact on its social structure, levels of inequality, and the daily lives of its people.

This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Causal relation: {Ethnic_Group} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of ethnic_Group_ID000001: 
An ethnic group is a group of people who are set apart from others because of their shared national origin or distinctive cultural patterns, which can include language, religion, traditions, customs, and shared history. Members of an ethnic group typically share a sense of common identity and belonging based on these cultural elements, which distinguish them from other groups in society. Ethnicity is a social construct, meaning that it is defined and maintained through social interaction and cultural practices rather than being based on fixed biological traits. The boundaries of ethnic groups can be fluid and may change over time due to factors such as migration, intermarriage, and social and political contexts. The study of ethnic groups is central to understanding cultural diversity, intergroup relations, and issues of identity and belonging in sociology.

Causal relation: {Ethnic_Group} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of social_Stratification_ID000006: 
Social stratification refers to the existence of structured inequalities between different groups in society in terms of their access to material or symbolic rewards, such as wealth, income, prestige, power, status, and opportunities. While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, significant and enduring patterns of inequality, leading to hierarchical arrangements of social groups, tend to arise with the development of more complex, state-based systems. The most distinctive and extensively studied form of stratification in modern societies involves class divisions, based primarily on economic factors, but stratification can also occur along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and other social categories. Sociologists examine the causes and consequences of social stratification, as well as the processes that maintain or challenge these inequalities over time.

Causal relation: {Ethnography, Participant_Observation} → observes → {Qualitative_Research, Cultural_Relativism}

Semantical explanation of ethnography_ID000001: 
Ethnography is a qualitative research method that involves the study of an entire social setting or cultural group through extended systematic observation and immersion in the field. Ethnographers aim to gain an in-depth understanding of the culture, behaviours, and social dynamics of the group being studied from the perspective of its members. This often involves the researcher spending a significant amount of time living among the people they are studying, participating in their daily activities, conducting interviews, and analysing cultural artifacts and symbols. The goal of ethnography is to provide a rich and detailed description of the social world of the group under study, capturing the nuances and complexities of their culture and social life. Ethnographic research is often used in anthropology and sociology to explore diverse cultural practices, social structures, and the meanings that people create and share in their everyday interactions.

Semantical explanation of participant_Observation_ID000001: 
Participant observation is a key method of research widely used in sociology and anthropology, particularly in ethnographic studies, in which the researcher takes part in the activities, routines, and daily life of a group or community being studied over an extended period of time, while also systematically observing their behaviour and interactions in their natural setting. The goal of participant observation is to gain an in-depth understanding of the group's culture, perspectives, and social world from an insider's point of view, by immersing oneself in their environment and experiencing life as they do. This method allows researchers to gather rich, qualitative data about social processes, meanings, and practices that may not be accessible through other research techniques like surveys or interviews alone.

Semantical explanation of qualitative_Research_ID000001: 
Qualitative research is a research approach that primarily relies on data that is not numerical and often involves studying social phenomena in their natural settings or "in the field" rather than in controlled laboratory environments. This type of research seeks to understand the qualities, characteristics, and meanings of social phenomena through methods such as observation, interviews, and the analysis of texts or artifacts. The focus is often on exploring the depth and complexity of experiences, perspectives, and social processes, rather than on quantifying them through statistical data. Qualitative research aims to provide rich, descriptive insights into the social world and the ways in which people interpret and make sense of their experiences.

Causal relation: {Ethnography, Participant_Observation} → observes → {Qualitative_Research, Cultural_Relativism}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Relativism_ID000001: 
Cultural relativism is a principle in social science that emphasises the viewing of people's behaviour from the perspective of their own culture, rather than judging it based on the standards of another culture. It suggests that different cultures have different norms, values, beliefs, and practices that are meaningful and functional within their own context. Therefore, to understand and analyse human behaviour, it is essential to consider the cultural framework in which it occurs. Cultural relativism encourages an attitude of openness and understanding towards cultural differences, helping to avoid ethnocentrism, which is the tendency to view one's own culture as superior and to judge other cultures based on one's own cultural norms. While cultural relativism is important for promoting cross-cultural understanding and tolerance, it does not necessarily imply that all cultural practices are equally acceptable or morally justifiable. Sociologists often use cultural relativism as a methodological tool to study and describe different cultures without imposing their own cultural biases.

Semantical explanation of nuclear_Family_ID000001: 
A nuclear family is a family group that consists of a mother, a father (or one of these parents in the case of single-parent families), and their dependent children living together in the same household. This family structure is often considered the traditional or dominant family form in many Western industrialised societies, although diverse family arrangements are increasingly common. The nuclear family is typically characterised by close emotional bonds, economic cooperation, and the responsibility of the adult members for the upbringing and well-being of their children. It plays a crucial role in the socialisation of children and provides a primary source of social support for its members.

Causal relation: {Nuclear_Family, Extended_Family} → adopts → {Adoption, Kinship}

Semantical explanation of extended_Family_ID000001: 
An extended family is a family group consisting of close relatives extending beyond a couple and their children, living either within the same household or in a close and continuous relationship with one another. This can include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and other kin who play a significant role in the family's social and economic life. Extended family structures were more common in pre-industrial societies and in many cultures around the world, where they often provided a strong network of support, shared resources, and collective caregiving. While the nuclear family (a couple and their dependent children) has become more prevalent in many Western industrialised societies, extended family ties continue to be important for many individuals and can provide valuable social, emotional, and practical support.

Causal relation: {Nuclear_Family, Extended_Family} → adopts → {Adoption, Kinship}

Semantical explanation of adoption_ID000001: 
Adoption is a legal process that allows for the permanent transfer of the legal rights, responsibilities, and privileges of parenthood to a new legal parent or parents from the biological or legal parents. Unlike guardianship, adoption is intended to create a permanent change in status, requiring societal recognition through legal or religious sanction. Historically, adoption practices often emphasised the adopter's political and economic interests, such as ensuring male heirs. However, modern adoption laws prioritise the child's welfare and development. Different types of adoption include foster care adoption, international adoption, and embryo adoption. Adoption is a complex process with emotional implications for adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents, often involving questions of identity and belonging. The evolution of adoption reflects changing societal values towards prioritizing the best interests of the child.

Semantical explanation of kinship_ID000001: 
Kinship refers to a social relation that links individuals through blood ties (consanguinity), marriage (affinity), or adoption, forming the basis of family and social organisation in many societies. These relationships define social roles, obligations, and expectations among individuals and groups, influencing patterns of inheritance, residence, and social support. Different cultures have diverse kinship systems that determine how family relationships are recognised and structured, including variations in descent patterns (e.g., patrilineal, matrilineal, bilateral) and the importance placed on different types of relatives. Kinship systems play a fundamental role in shaping social organisation, cultural practices, and individual identities in societies around the world.

Semantical explanation of family_ID000003: 
A family is a group of individuals related to one another by blood ties, marriage, or adoption who form an economic unit, the adult members of which are responsible for the upbringing of children. All known societies involve some form of family system, although the nature of family relationships is widely variable across cultures and throughout history. While in modern societies the main family form is often considered the nuclear family (a couple and their dependent children), a variety of extended family relationships (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) are also frequently found and play important roles in individuals' lives. The family serves as a primary agent of socialisation, providing emotional support, care, and a sense of belonging for its members. It also plays a crucial role in the transmission of cultural norms, values, and traditions across generations.

Causal relation: {Family} → reproduces → {Cultural_Reproduction}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Reproduction_ID000003: 
Cultural reproduction refers to the process by which a society transmits dominant knowledge, values, beliefs, and social inequalities from one generation to another. This transmission occurs through various social institutions, including the family, education system, media, and religion. Cultural reproduction theory, particularly associated with the work of Pierre Bourdieu and Basil Bernstein, highlights how the dominant culture in a society tends to be perpetuated, often reinforcing existing power structures and social hierarchies. For example, the education system may prioritise certain forms of knowledge and cultural capital that are more readily accessible to children from privileged backgrounds, thereby contributing to their continued success and the reproduction of social class differences across generations. Similarly, the media can play a role in shaping and reinforcing dominant ideologies and cultural norms. Understanding cultural reproduction helps sociologists analyse how social inequalities are maintained and transmitted over time, even in the absence of overt discrimination.

Causal relation: {Law, State} → regulates → {Marriage, Family}

Semantical explanation of law_ID000002: 
Law refers to governmental social control, representing a formal system of rules and regulations enacted and enforced by political authorities to govern behaviour and maintain social order within a society. Laws are typically written down and specify both the behaviours that are prohibited or required and the sanctions or penalties that will be applied when violations occur. The legal system includes various institutions, such as legislatures that create laws, law enforcement agencies that enforce them, and courts that interpret laws and adjudicate disputes. Law plays a crucial role in establishing norms, resolving conflicts, protecting rights, and providing a framework for social interaction in complex societies. The legitimacy and effectiveness of law depend on its acceptance by the people it governs and its consistent and fair application.

Causal relation: {Law, State} → regulates → {Marriage, Family}

Semantical explanation of state_ID000001: 
The state in sociology refers to a political apparatus or organised structure of rule that governs a specific territory and its population, characterised by its authority, which is generally backed by law, and its capacity to use force to maintain order and enforce its policies. It typically includes governmental institutions such as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as the civil service officials who administer state functions. A key feature of the state is its claim to sovereignty over the territory and its citizens, meaning it asserts the ultimate authority within its borders, often recognised by other states in the international system. The state plays a crucial role in establishing and enforcing laws, providing public services, regulating the economy, and defending its territory and interests, often relying on a monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within its boundaries to ensure compliance and maintain social order.

Causal relation: {Law, State} → regulates → {Marriage, Family}

Semantical explanation of marriage_ID000001: 
Marriage is a legally and socially sanctioned relationship between two or more people (though typically two), involving economic cooperation, emotional intimacy, and often normative sexual activity and child-bearing, which the individuals and society expect to be enduring or relatively permanent. The definition and practices of marriage vary significantly across cultures and have evolved over time, with changes in who can marry (e.g., same-sex marriage), the purposes of marriage (beyond procreation to include companionship and personal fulfillment), and the prevalence of different forms of marriage (e.g., monogamy, polygamy). Marriage often establishes kinship ties and defines rights and obligations between spouses and their families. It is a fundamental social institution that plays a crucial role in regulating sexual behaviour, organizing family life, and transmitting social status and property across generations.

Causal relation: {Law, State} → regulates → {Marriage, Family}

Semantical explanation of family_ID000004: 
A family is a group of individuals related to one another by blood ties, marriage, or adoption who form an economic unit, the adult members of which are responsible for the upbringing of children. All known societies involve some form of family system, although the nature of family relationships is widely variable across cultures and throughout history. While in modern societies the main family form is often considered the nuclear family (a couple and their dependent children), a variety of extended family relationships (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) are also frequently found and play important roles in individuals' lives. The family serves as a primary agent of socialisation, providing emotional support, care, and a sense of belonging for its members.

Causal relation: {Education, Hidden_Curriculum} → educates → {Secondary_Socialisation, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of education_ID000012: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility. Sociologists study education to understand its impact on social inequality, its relationship to the economy, and its role in shaping individual identities and life chances.

Causal relation: {Education, Hidden_Curriculum} → educates → {Secondary_Socialisation, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of hidden_Curriculum_ID000002: 
The hidden curriculum refers to the unstated or subtle standards of behaviour, attitudes, values, and beliefs that are deemed proper by society and are taught implicitly in schools through the everyday practices, routines, and social interactions within the educational environment, rather than through the formal academic curriculum. This can include learning about punctuality, obedience to authority, competition, conformity to rules, and the importance of social hierarchies. The hidden curriculum plays a significant role in the socialisation of students, shaping their understanding of social norms, expectations, and power dynamics in ways that may not be explicitly stated but are nonetheless influential in preparing them for their roles in the broader society and the workplace. Sociologists study the hidden curriculum to understand how schools contribute to the reproduction of social inequalities and the transmission of dominant cultural values.

Causal relation: {Education, Hidden_Curriculum} → educates → {Secondary_Socialisation, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of secondary_Socialisation_ID000001: 
Secondary Socialisation is the process of learning and internalizing the norms, values, behaviours, and roles that are specific to particular social groups, institutions, or contexts outside of the primary family environment. This stage of socialisation typically occurs during adolescence and adulthood, building upon the foundational learning acquired during primary socialisation. Key agents of secondary socialisation include schools (where individuals learn academic knowledge, punctuality, and conformity to formal rules), peer groups (influencing social behaviours, identity formation, and cultural trends), religious institutions (imparting moral beliefs and practices), and the workplace (socializing individuals into professional roles, organisational culture, and specific job responsibilities). Unlike the intimate and emotionally charged nature of primary socialisation, secondary socialisation often involves more impersonal and instrumental relationships, as individuals learn how to navigate diverse social settings and adopt appropriate behaviours for new roles and statuses in a complex society. It is a continuous process of adaptation and learning throughout the life course.

Causal relation: {Education, Hidden_Curriculum} → educates → {Secondary_Socialisation, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Capital_ID000006: 
Cultural capital, a concept developed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, refers to the types of knowledge, skills, education, and other cultural resources that confer advantages on those who acquire them, providing them with social mobility and status within a society. Bourdieu identified three forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalised. Embodied cultural capital exists in the form of knowledge and skills that are consciously acquired and passively inherited, such as language proficiency, manners, tastes, and dispositions. These are often learned through socialisation within a particular social class or cultural environment. Objectified cultural capital refers to cultural goods such as books, artworks, musical instruments, and other material objects that can be owned and transmitted. However, the possession of these objects is not sufficient; one must also have the cultural competence to understand and appreciate them to fully benefit from this form of capital. Institutionalised cultural capital consists of academic credentials, professional qualifications, and other forms of formal recognition that legitimate an individual's cultural competence and confer social advantages in the labor market and other social institutions. Cultural capital plays a significant role in social reproduction, as individuals from privileged backgrounds often possess more cultural capital, which helps them succeed in educational systems and gain access to higher-status occupations, thereby perpetuating social inequalities across generations.

Causal relation: {Gender_Inequality, Patriarchy} → discriminatesAgainst → {Gender_Stratification, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of gender_Inequality_ID000001: 
Gender inequality refers to the differences in the status, power, prestige, opportunities, and resources that women and men have in groups, collectivities, and societies. This inequality is often manifested in various forms, including disparities in economic opportunities and earnings (such as the gender pay gap), political representation and influence, access to education and healthcare, and social and cultural norms that privilege one gender over the other, typically men. Gender inequality is a pervasive issue across many societies, although its specific forms and extent can vary significantly across cultures and historical periods. Feminist theories in sociology aim to understand the social, cultural, and historical roots of gender inequality and to advocate for social change that promotes gender equality and justice.

Causal relation: {Gender_Inequality, Patriarchy} → discriminatesAgainst → {Gender_Stratification, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of patriarchy_ID000001: 
Patriarchy is a form of social organisation in which men hold the primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property, and in the domain of the family where fathers or father figures hold authority over women and children. This system often involves the oppression and exploitation of women, who typically have less access to resources and decision-making processes. Patriarchal structures are prevalent in many societies throughout history and continue to shape gender relations and social inequalities in various ways, influencing laws, customs, and cultural norms that often favour men and limit the opportunities and autonomy of women.

Causal relation: {Gender_Inequality, Patriarchy} → discriminatesAgainst → {Gender_Stratification, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of gender_Stratification_ID000001: 
Gender stratification refers to a society's unequal distribution of wealth, power, and privilege between the two sexes, with one gender (typically men) holding a disproportionate share of these resources and social advantages. This hierarchical arrangement is evident in various aspects of social life, including the economic sphere (e.g., the gender pay gap, occupational segregation), the political arena (e.g., underrepresentation of women in leadership positions), and social institutions (e.g., differential treatment in education and healthcare). Gender stratification is not simply a matter of individual differences but is embedded in the social structure and perpetuated by cultural norms, beliefs, and practices that often favour men and disadvantage women. Feminist theories in sociology critically examine the causes and consequences of gender stratification and advocate for social equality between the sexes.

Causal relation: {Gender_Inequality, Patriarchy} → discriminatesAgainst → {Gender_Stratification, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000007: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Semantical explanation of patriarchy_ID000002: 
Patriarchy is a form of social organisation in which men hold the primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property, and in the domain of the family where fathers or father figures hold authority over women and children. This system often involves the oppression and exploitation of women, who typically have less access to resources and decision-making processes. Patriarchal structures are prevalent in many societies throughout history and continue to shape gender relations and social inequalities in various ways, influencing laws, customs, and cultural norms that often favour men and limit the opportunities and autonomy of women.

Semantical explanation of gender_Inequality_ID000002: 
Gender inequality refers to the differences in the status, power, prestige, opportunities, and resources that women and men have in groups, collectivities, and societies. This inequality is often manifested in various forms, including disparities in economic opportunities and earnings (such as the gender pay gap), political representation and influence, access to education and healthcare, and social and cultural norms that privilege one gender over the other, typically men. Gender inequality is a pervasive issue across many societies, although its specific forms and extent can vary significantly across cultures and historical periods. Feminist theories in sociology aim to understand the social, cultural, and historical roots of gender inequality and to advocate for social change that promotes gender equality and justice.

Causal relation: {Gender_Stratification, Patriarchy} → stratifies → {Gender_Inequality, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of social_Inequality_ID000007: 
Social inequality refers to a condition within a society in which its members have significantly different amounts of wealth, income, prestige, power, or other valued resources and opportunities. This unequal distribution can be based on various social categories such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability, often resulting in hierarchical arrangements where some groups have more access to resources and privileges than others. Social inequality is a fundamental topic of study in sociology, with researchers examining its causes, consequences, and the ways in which it is maintained and challenged over time. It can manifest in various forms, including economic disparities, differences in social status and respect, and unequal access to political influence and decision-making power.

Causal relation: {Gentrification, Urban_Renewal} → excludes → {Working_Class, Poverty}

Semantical explanation of gentrification_ID000001: 
Gentrification is a process of urban renewal in which older, decaying housing and neighborhoods in central city areas are refurbished and revitalised by more affluent people, often resulting in the displacement of the original, lower-income residents. This process typically involves the renovation of buildings, the influx of new businesses and amenities catering to a higher-income clientele, and an increase in property values and rents, making the area unaffordable for many of its long-term residents. While gentrification can lead to the physical improvement of neglected urban areas, it often raises concerns about social equity and the displacement of vulnerable populations, potentially leading to the loss of affordable housing and the disruption of established communities. The causes and consequences of gentrification are complex and have been a subject of much sociological research and debate, with discussions focusing on issues of urban planning, housing policy, and social justice.

Causal relation: {Gentrification, Urban_Renewal} → excludes → {Working_Class, Poverty}

Semantical explanation of urban_Renewal_ID000001: 
Urban renewal is a comprehensive process aimed at reviving and revitalizing deteriorating neighborhoods and urban areas that may be experiencing decline, disinvestment, or social problems. It typically involves a range of strategies, such as recycling underutilised land and existing buildings for new purposes, improving the physical environment through infrastructure upgrades and beautification projects, implementing better management practices for local areas with the active participation of local citizens, and strategically using public funds to stimulate regeneration and attract further private investment. The goals of urban renewal often include enhancing the quality of life for residents, fostering economic development, improving housing conditions, and creating more vibrant and sustainable urban communities. However, urban renewal projects can sometimes lead to unintended consequences such as gentrification and the displacement of existing low-income residents, making community engagement and equitable planning crucial aspects of the process.

Causal relation: {Gentrification, Urban_Renewal} → excludes → {Working_Class, Poverty}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000008: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Causal relation: {Gentrification, Urban_Renewal} → excludes → {Working_Class, Poverty}

Semantical explanation of poverty_ID000001: 
Poverty refers to a state of deprivation where individuals or families lack the sufficient financial resources or material possessions to meet their basic needs or maintain a living standard considered customary in their society. This broad category encompasses various forms, most commonly distinguished as absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty, also known as subsistence poverty, defines a condition where individuals lack the minimal resources required for basic survival, such as food, shelter, warmth, and safety, often measured by a fixed income threshold. Relative poverty, conversely, defines deprivation in relation to the living standards and average income levels of the majority within a particular society, implying social exclusion and a reduced ability to participate fully in customary activities. The feminisation of poverty highlights the increasing proportion of women among the poor. Poverty is a complex social problem influenced by economic systems, social inequalities, access to resources, and various structural and individual factors, leading to significant social and health consequences.

Causal relation: {Gentrification} → gentrifies → {Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of gentrification_ID000002: 
Gentrification is a process of urban renewal in which older, decaying housing and neighborhoods in central city areas are refurbished and revitalised by more affluent people, often resulting in the displacement of the original, lower-income residents. This process typically involves the renovation of buildings, the influx of new businesses and amenities catering to a higher-income clientele, and an increase in property values and rents, making the area unaffordable for many of its long-term residents. While gentrification can lead to the physical improvement of neglected urban areas, it often raises concerns about social equity and the displacement of vulnerable populations, potentially leading to the loss of affordable housing and the disruption of established communities. The causes and consequences of gentrification are complex and have been a subject of much sociological research and debate, with discussions focusing on issues of urban planning, housing policy, and social justice.

Causal relation: {Gentrification} → gentrifies → {Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000009: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Causal relation: {Global_Village, Internet} → hasInfluence → {Culture, Social_Change, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of global_Village_ID000001: 
Global village is a notion associated with the Canadian writer and media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who envisioned the spread of electronic communication technologies, such as television and later the internet, as binding the world into a single, interconnected community, akin to a small village where everyone knows everyone else and information travels rapidly. McLuhan argued that electronic media collapses time and space, allowing people from different parts of the world to interact and share experiences in real-time, fostering a sense of global interconnectedness and shared consciousness. While the "global village" concept highlights the potential for increased communication and understanding across cultures, it has also been critiqued for overlooking issues of power imbalances, cultural homogenisation, and the digital divide that exists in access to technology and information worldwide.

Semantical explanation of internet_ID000005: 
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that allows people to communicate with one another and find information on the Worldwide Web by exchanging data in various forms, including visuals, sounds, and text. This vast network operates in a way that largely transcends the limitations of time, physical space, and the traditional costs and control mechanisms associated with distance and territorial governments. The Internet has become an indispensable tool for communication, education, commerce, entertainment, and social interaction, connecting billions of people around the world and providing access to an unprecedented amount of information and resources. Its decentralised nature and open architecture have fostered innovation and the rapid development of new technologies and applications, transforming many aspects of modern life and contributing to the phenomenon of globalisation.

Causal relation: {Global_Village, Internet} → hasInfluence → {Culture, Social_Change, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of culture_ID000006: 
Culture encompasses the values, beliefs, ceremonies, ways of life, norms, symbols, and material goods characteristic of a given group or society. Like the concept of society, the notion of culture is very widely used in sociology, as well as in other social sciences, particularly anthropology. Culture is one of the most distinctive properties of human social association, differentiating human societies from animal societies in its complexity and transmission through learning rather than solely through instinct. It includes everything that is learned and shared by the members of a society, shaping their behaviour and their understanding of the world. Culture can be broadly divided into material culture, which includes tangible objects created by a society (such as tools, technology, clothing, and art), and nonmaterial culture, which includes intangible aspects such as ideas, values, beliefs, norms, language, and social institutions. Culture provides a framework for social interaction, defines what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and gives meaning to people's lives. It is dynamic and constantly evolving through processes of innovation, diffusion, and adaptation.

Semantical explanation of social_Change_ID000008: 
Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Causal relation: {Global_Village, Internet} → hasInfluence → {Culture, Social_Change, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of social_Roles_ID000002: 
Social_Roles represents the organised system of behavioural expectations, positions, and identities that individuals occupy within social structures and through which social interaction is organised and regulated. This category encompasses the fundamental mechanisms through which societies organise human behaviour and social relationships, including both positions that individuals achieve through their actions and those that are ascribed based on characteristics beyond their control. The concept includes the hierarchical dimension of social positions through status systems and the specialised behavioural expectations associated with particular social positions. Gender roles represent culturally defined expectations based on sex categories, while the sick role exemplifies how societies organise responses to illness and health conditions. Master status refers to dominant identity categories that override other social positions in social interaction. The category captures how societies create and maintain social order through the assignment and performance of differentiated roles that coordinate individual behaviour with collective needs and expectations. These roles serve as bridges between individual identity and social structure, providing frameworks for social interaction, identity formation, and the reproduction of social patterns across time and social contexts.

Causal relation: {Government} → governs → {Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of government_ID000001: 
Government refers to the regular enactment of policies, decisions, and matters of state by officials within a political apparatus, representing the formal organisation that has the authority to make and enforce laws and regulations within a specific territory or society. It encompasses the various institutions and processes through which a state exercises its power and authority, including legislative bodies that create laws, executive branches that implement and enforce them, and judicial systems that interpret laws and resolve disputes. Governments play a crucial role in maintaining social order, providing public services, regulating the economy, and representing the interests of the state in its interactions with other nations. The form and structure of government can vary widely, ranging from democracies to authoritarian regimes, each with different mechanisms for the selection of officials and the exercise of power. Political sociology examines the role of government in society, its relationship with citizens and other social institutions, and the factors that influence its policies and actions.

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000001: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Causal relation: {Healthcare} → mobilises → {Mortality_Rate, Health_Maintenance_Orgs, Social_Epidemiology}

Semantical explanation of healthcare_ID000001: 
Healthcare, in sociology, refers to the social institution and complex system of organisations, professionals, and practices dedicated to maintaining and improving the physical, mental, and social well-being of individuals and populations. This domain encompasses a wide range of services, including medical diagnosis and treatment, disease prevention, health promotion, rehabilitation, and palliative care. Sociologists examine the social determinants of health and illness, investigating how factors like socioeconomic status, race, gender, and geographic location influence health disparities and access to care. The study of healthcare also analyses the social organisation of medical practices, the roles of healthcare providers and patients, the social construction of health and illness (e.g., the sick role), and the impact of health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and holistic medicine approaches. It critically assesses healthcare policies, inequalities in health outcomes, and the broader societal implications of health and disease.

Causal relation: {Healthcare} → mobilises → {Mortality_Rate, Health_Maintenance_Orgs, Social_Epidemiology}

Semantical explanation of mortality_Rate_ID000001: 
Mortality rate refers to the incidence of death in a given population during a specific period of time, typically one year, and is often expressed as the number of deaths per 1,000 or 100,000 people in the population. It is a fundamental demographic indicator used to assess the health status of a population, track changes in death patterns over time, and make comparisons across different groups or regions. Mortality rates can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including age structure of the population, prevalence of diseases, access to healthcare, nutritional levels, environmental conditions, and socioeconomic factors. Specific mortality rates can be calculated for different age groups, sexes, or causes of death to provide more detailed insights into the patterns of mortality within a population. The crude death rate, which measures the total number of deaths in a year per 1,000 population, is a basic but widely used measure of mortality.

Causal relation: {Healthcare} → mobilises → {Mortality_Rate, Health_Maintenance_Orgs, Social_Epidemiology}

Semantical explanation of health_Maintenance_Orgs_ID000001: 
Health maintenance organisations (HMOs) are a type of managed healthcare organisation that provides comprehensive medical services to its enrolled members for a preestablished fee, typically paid on a monthly basis, regardless of how often the services are used. HMOs aim to control healthcare costs by emphasizing preventive care and requiring members to choose a primary care physician (PCP) who acts as a gatekeeper, coordinating their care and providing referrals to specialists when necessary. HMOs often have a network of doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers that members must use to receive coverage, except in cases of emergency. While HMOs can help to make healthcare more affordable and predictable in terms of cost, they have also been criticised for potentially limiting patients' choice of providers and sometimes prioritizing cost-cutting over the quality of care.

Semantical explanation of social_Epidemiology_ID000001: 
Social epidemiology is a subfield within epidemiology and sociology that focuses on the study of the social determinants of health, examining the distribution of disease, impairment, and general health status across a population and identifying the social factors, such as socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, gender, social networks, and neighborhood conditions, that influence health outcomes and contribute to health inequalities within and between populations. Social epidemiologists investigate how these social factors affect the risk, incidence, prevalence, and progression of diseases, as well as overall well-being, aiming to understand the underlying social mechanisms that shape health and to inform public health policies and interventions that can reduce health disparities and promote health equity.

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000002: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Causal relation: {Healthcare, Health_Maintenance_Orgs} → medicinalises → {Social_Control, Sick_Role}

Semantical explanation of sick_Role_ID000001: 
The sick role is a concept in medical sociology, developed by Talcott Parsons, that describes the societal expectations and norms surrounding the attitudes and behaviour of a person who is viewed as being ill. According to this concept, when individuals are sick, they are generally expected to adopt certain behaviours, such as seeking medical attention, trying to get well, and cooperating with healthcare professionals. In return, they are often granted certain exemptions from normal social responsibilities, such as work or school, and are not held responsible for their condition. However, these exemptions are typically conditional on the individual actively trying to recover and return to their normal social roles. The sick role highlights the social aspects of illness and how society shapes our understanding and responses to being sick.

Semantical explanation of education_ID000013: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility. Sociologists study education to understand its impact on social inequality, its relationship to the economy, and its role in shaping individual identities and life chances.

Causal relation: {Education, Cultural_Capital} → educates → {Social_Class, Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Capital_ID000007: 
Cultural capital, a concept developed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, refers to the types of knowledge, skills, education, and other cultural resources that confer advantages on those who acquire them, providing them with social mobility and status within a society. Bourdieu identified three forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalised. Embodied cultural capital exists in the form of knowledge and skills that are consciously acquired and passively inherited, such as language proficiency, manners, tastes, and dispositions. These are often learned through socialisation within a particular social class or cultural environment. Objectified cultural capital refers to cultural goods such as books, artworks, musical instruments, and other material objects that can be owned and transmitted. However, the possession of these objects is not sufficient; one must also have the cultural competence to understand and appreciate them to fully benefit from this form of capital. Institutionalised cultural capital consists of academic credentials, professional qualifications, and other forms of formal recognition that legitimate an individual's cultural competence and confer social advantages in the labor market and other social institutions. Cultural capital plays a significant role in social reproduction, as individuals from privileged backgrounds often possess more cultural capital, which helps them succeed in educational systems and gain access to higher-status occupations, thereby perpetuating social inequalities across generations.

Causal relation: {Education, Cultural_Capital} → educates → {Social_Class, Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000006: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Education, Cultural_Capital} → educates → {Social_Class, Social_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of social_Stratification_ID000007: 
Social stratification refers to the existence of structured inequalities between different groups in society in terms of their access to material or symbolic rewards, such as wealth, income, prestige, power, status, and opportunities. While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, significant and enduring patterns of inequality, leading to hierarchical arrangements of social groups, tend to arise with the development of more complex, state-based systems. The most distinctive and extensively studied form of stratification in modern societies involves class divisions, based primarily on economic factors, but stratification can also occur along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and other social categories. Sociologists examine the causes and consequences of social stratification, as well as the processes that maintain or challenge these inequalities over time.

Semantical explanation of immigration_ID000001: 
Immigration is the movement of people into one country from another with the intention of settling permanently or for an extended period. This cross-border migration can occur for a variety of reasons, including seeking better economic opportunities, escaping poverty, conflict, or persecution, joining family members, or pursuing education and personal development. Immigration has significant social, economic, and cultural impacts on both the sending and receiving countries, contributing to population growth and diversity, influencing labor markets, and shaping cultural landscapes. The experiences of immigrants can vary widely depending on factors such as their reasons for migrating, their skills and resources, the policies and attitudes of the host country, and the presence of established immigrant communities.

Causal relation: {Immigration, Cultural_Diversity} → influencesHistorically → {Cultural_Pluralism, Culture_Shock}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Diversity_ID000002: 
Cultural Diversity refers to the variety and richness of different cultures, subcultures, and ethnic groups that coexist within a given society or across the globe. It encompasses the wide array of unique values, norms, beliefs, languages, customs, traditions, social practices, and forms of expression that distinguish these groups from one another. This diversity contributes to the multifaceted nature of human society, reflecting the myriad ways in which people organise their lives, understand the world, and express themselves. Cultural diversity is often celebrated for enriching society by fostering innovation, creativity, a broader range of perspectives, and a more vibrant cultural landscape, thereby enhancing cultural vitality and mutual understanding. However, it can also present challenges related to social cohesion, intergroup relations, and potential conflicts arising from differing values, competing interests, or the historical legacies of power imbalances and discrimination. Sociologists study cultural diversity to understand how different groups maintain their distinct identities while interacting within a larger social framework, and how societies manage diversity to promote inclusion, equality, and social harmony, moving beyond assimilationist models towards valuing cultural pluralism and multiculturalism, and addressing issues like prejudice and segregation.

Causal relation: {Immigration, Cultural_Diversity} → influencesHistorically → {Cultural_Pluralism, Culture_Shock}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Pluralism_ID000001: 
Cultural pluralism refers to the coexistence of several subcultures within a given society on equal terms, where no single culture dominates and all are recognised and respected for their distinct contributions. In a culturally pluralistic society, different ethnic, racial, religious, and other cultural groups are able to maintain their unique identities, traditions, and practices while participating fully in the broader society. This is often contrasted with assimilation, where minority groups are expected to adopt the culture of the dominant group. Cultural pluralism emphasises the value of diversity and the benefits of having a society enriched by multiple perspectives and traditions. It requires a degree of tolerance and mutual respect among different cultural groups and often involves policies and practices that protect the rights and promote the inclusion of all cultural groups within the society. The concept of a "salad bowl" is often used as a metaphor for cultural pluralism, where different ingredients (cultures) are mixed together but retain their individual flavors and characteristics, rather than being completely blended into a single entity like in a "melting pot" (often used to describe amalgamation).

Causal relation: {Immigration, Cultural_Diversity} → influencesHistorically → {Cultural_Pluralism, Culture_Shock}

Semantical explanation of culture_Shock_ID000001: 
Culture shock is the feeling of surprise and disorientation that is experienced when people witness cultural practices, values, norms, and beliefs that are significantly different from their own. This phenomenon typically occurs when individuals are immersed in a new and unfamiliar cultural environment, such as when traveling to a foreign country, moving to a different region within their own country with distinct cultural norms, or even when experiencing a significant change in social environment, like starting a new job with a very different organisational culture. The disorientation arises from the lack of familiar cues and expectations that guide behaviour in one's own culture, leading to feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, and sometimes even hostility towards the new cultural context. Culture shock can affect various aspects of daily life, including communication styles, social etiquette, food, customs, and even basic assumptions about how the world works. While often challenging, experiencing and overcoming culture shock can also lead to personal growth, increased cultural awareness, and a deeper understanding of both one's own culture and others. The process of adapting to a new culture involves learning new norms, values, and behaviours, and gradually adjusting one's own perspectives and practices to fit the new environment.

Semantical explanation of industrial_Revolution_ID000001: 
The Industrial Revolution refers to the broad spectrum of profound social and economic transformations that surrounded the development of modern forms of industry, beginning in Great Britain in the late 18th century and spreading to other parts of the world throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. This period was marked by significant technological innovations, particularly the invention of new machines and the use of new energy sources like steam power, which led to the rise of factory-based production and a shift from agrarian-based economies to those dominated by manufacturing and industry. The Industrial Revolution had far-reaching consequences, leading to urbanisation, the growth of new social classes, changes in family structures, and significant alterations in people's daily lives and ways of working. It laid the foundation for modern industrial societies and continues to shape the world today through ongoing technological advancements and their social and economic impacts.

Causal relation: {Industrial_Revolution, Industrialism} → urbanises → {Industrial_City, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of industrialism_ID000002: 
Industrialism refers to a social and economic system characterised by the extensive use of technology, particularly sophisticated machinery powered by advanced sources of energy such as fossil fuels and electricity, to produce goods and services on a large scale. It is the driving force behind industrial societies, leading to mass production, specialisation of labor, and the growth of factories and urban centers. Industrialism has transformed the way people live and work, leading to unprecedented levels of material wealth and technological progress in many parts of the world. However, it has also brought about social changes, such as the rise of new social classes and new forms of social inequality, as well as environmental challenges related to resource consumption and pollution. The study of industrialism examines its historical development, its social and economic consequences, and its ongoing evolution in the face of new technological innovations and global challenges.

Causal relation: {Industrial_Revolution, Industrialism} → urbanises → {Industrial_City, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of industrial_City_ID000001: 
An industrial city is a type of urban center characterised by its relatively large size and population density, a dynamic and often competitive environment, a more open class system compared to pre-industrial societies, and a significant level of elaborate specialisation in the manufacturing of goods and the provision of related services. These cities emerged and grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, becoming centers of production, innovation, and migration, attracting large numbers of people seeking employment in factories and related industries. The social structure of industrial cities often reflects a greater degree of social mobility based on achieved status compared to more traditional, agrarian-based societies. However, they can also be characterised by social inequalities and challenges associated with rapid urbanisation, such as overcrowding, pollution, and the development of distinct social and economic neighborhoods.

Causal relation: {Industrial_Revolution, Industrialism} → urbanises → {Industrial_City, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000010: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Causal relation: {Industrial_City, Industrialism} → urbanises → {Urban_Ecology, Postindustrial_City}

Semantical explanation of industrialism_ID000003: 
Industrialism refers to a social and economic system characterised by the extensive use of technology, particularly sophisticated machinery powered by advanced sources of energy such as fossil fuels and electricity, to produce goods and services on a large scale. It is the driving force behind industrial societies, leading to mass production, specialisation of labor, and the growth of factories and urban centers. Industrialism has transformed the way people live and work, leading to unprecedented levels of material wealth and technological progress in many parts of the world. However, it has also brought about social changes, such as the rise of new social classes and new forms of social inequality, as well as environmental challenges related to resource consumption and pollution. The study of industrialism examines its historical development, its social and economic consequences, and its ongoing evolution in the face of new technological innovations and global challenges.

Causal relation: {Industrial_City, Industrialism} → urbanises → {Urban_Ecology, Postindustrial_City}

Semantical explanation of urban_Ecology_ID000001: 
Urban ecology is a subfield within sociology that focuses on the study of the intricate link and dynamic interrelationships between the physical and social dimensions of cities, examining how the spatial organisation, physical environment, and material infrastructure of urban areas shape social life, human behaviour, and community dynamics, and vice versa. It explores topics such as the distribution of populations, resources, and social problems within urban spaces, the impact of urban design and planning on social interactions, the relationship between urban environments and human health, and the processes of urban growth, change, and sustainability. Drawing on ecological principles, urban ecology views the city as a complex ecosystem where social and physical factors are interdependent and constantly interacting to shape the urban experience.

Causal relation: {Industrial_City, Industrialism} → urbanises → {Urban_Ecology, Postindustrial_City}

Semantical explanation of postindustrial_City_ID000001: 
A postindustrial city is an urban center in which the economy is dominated by global finance, the electronic flow of information, technology, services, and consumption, rather than traditional manufacturing and industrial activities. These cities often serve as hubs for financial institutions, corporate headquarters, research and development, and high-technology industries, playing a central role in the global knowledge economy. The landscape and social structure of postindustrial cities may reflect this shift, with a decline in industrial areas and a growth in office buildings, service-oriented businesses, and residential areas catering to a more diverse and often highly skilled workforce.

Causal relation: {Industrial_Society} → urbanises → {Urbanisation}

Semantical explanation of industrial_Society_ID000001: 
An industrial society is a type of society that depends primarily on mechanisation, advanced technology, and sophisticated machinery powered by advanced energy sources to produce its economic goods and services on a large scale. This form of society emerged with the Industrial Revolution and is characterised by a complex division of labor, a high degree of urbanisation as people move to centers of production, and a reliance on manufacturing and industrial processes rather than agriculture as the main source of economic activity. Industrial societies typically have a more complex social structure with greater social mobility compared to pre-industrial societies, although they can also experience significant social inequalities related to the distribution of wealth and power in the industrial economy. The development of industrial societies has led to significant increases in productivity, material wealth, and standards of living in many parts of the world, but also to new social and environmental challenges.

Causal relation: {Industrial_Society} → urbanises → {Urbanisation}

Semantical explanation of urbanisation_ID000001: 
Urbanisation refers to the process of the development of towns and cities, typically involving the growth in the size and population of urban areas and the increasing concentration of people living and working in these areas. This process is often linked to economic development, industrialisation, and the migration of people from rural to urban areas in search of opportunities. Urbanisation leads to significant transformations in land use, infrastructure development, social organisation, and lifestyles, creating complex urban environments that serve as centers of economic, political, and cultural activity. The study of urbanisation examines its causes, patterns, and consequences for societies, including issues related to urban planning, housing, transportation, social inequality, and environmental sustainability.

Causal relation: {Influence} → hasInfluence → {Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of influence_ID000001: 
Influence refers to the exercise of power through a process of persuasion, where one individual or group is able to affect the thoughts, feelings, or behaviours of others without resorting to explicit force or coercion. It relies on the ability to convince or convince others to adopt a particular viewpoint, take a specific action, or support a certain cause through communication, reasoning, and the appeal to shared values or interests. Influence can operate through various channels, including personal relationships, social networks, media, and public discourse. It is a key aspect of social interaction and plays a significant role in shaping social norms, group dynamics, and political processes. Informal norms, which are generally understood rules of behaviour within a group or society but are not precisely recorded or formally enforced, often exert influence on individuals' actions through social expectations and the potential for social approval or disapproval.

Causal relation: {Influence} → hasInfluence → {Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of social_Cohesion_ID000002: 
Social Cohesion refers to the degree of solidarity, unity, and sense of belonging that exists among individuals and groups within a society, reflecting the bonds that tie people together and enable them to live and work together effectively. It is characterised by shared values, common norms, mutual trust, and a willingness to cooperate for the collective good. Ã‰mile Durkheim identified two types of social cohesion: mechanical solidarity, found in traditional societies based on homogeneity and shared morality, and organic solidarity, prevalent in modern, complex societies based on interdependence and specialisation. High levels of social cohesion contribute to social stability, order, and collective well-being, fostering a sense of community and mutual support. Conversely, a lack of social cohesion can lead to social disorganisation, conflict, and a sense of anomie or normlessness among individuals.

Semantical explanation of innovation_ID000005: 
Innovation is the process of introducing new elements, ideas, methods, or products into a culture or society, leading to change and often improvement. This can occur through two primary mechanisms: discovery and invention. Discovery involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown or unrecognised, such as a new scientific fact or a previously unknown natural resource. Invention, on the other hand, involves creating something entirely new that did not exist before, such as a new technology, a new tool, or a new process. Both discovery and invention can have profound impacts on a culture, leading to new practices, beliefs, social structures, and material advancements. The rate and nature of innovation can vary significantly across different societies and historical periods, influenced by factors such as technological development, cultural values, and social organisation.

Semantical explanation of economy_ID000006: 
The economy refers to the system of production and exchange which provides for the material needs of individuals living in a given society. It encompasses all activities related to the creation, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The economy is a fundamental aspect of social life, as it shapes how people earn a living, access resources, and interact with one another in the process of fulfilling their material needs and wants. The structure and functioning of the economy are influenced by a complex interplay of social, cultural, political, and technological factors. Sociologists study the economy to understand its impact on social inequality, social mobility, work, and other aspects of social life. Different types of economies, such as agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial economies, have distinct characteristics and social consequences.

Semantical explanation of social_Institutions_ID000001: 
Social Institutions represent complex, enduring, and organised sets of norms, values, statuses, roles, and groups that are established and accepted as fundamental components of a society's structure, primarily organised to meet basic human needs and perform essential societal functions. These major spheres of social life, such as the family, education, religion, government, and the economy, provide a framework for social interaction, guide individual and group behaviour, and contribute to the overall stability and continuity of society. Each institution has its own specific purposes, functions, and established ways of operating, and they are interconnected, influencing and being influenced by one another. Sociologists study social institutions to understand how they are structured, how they function, and how they evolve over time, as well as their impact on individuals and the perpetuation of social inequalities within a society.

Causal relation: {Social_Institutions, Law} → controls → {Social_Control, Formal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of law_ID000003: 
Law refers to governmental social control, representing a formal system of rules and regulations enacted and enforced by political authorities to govern behaviour and maintain social order within a society. Laws are typically written down and specify both the behaviours that are prohibited or required and the sanctions or penalties that will be applied when violations occur. The legal system includes various institutions, such as legislatures that create laws, law enforcement agencies that enforce them, and courts that interpret laws and adjudicate disputes. Law plays a crucial role in establishing norms, resolving conflicts, protecting rights, and providing a framework for social interaction in complex societies. The legitimacy and effectiveness of law depend on its acceptance by the people it governs and its consistent and fair application.

Causal relation: {Social_Institutions, Law} → controls → {Social_Control, Formal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000003: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Causal relation: {Social_Institutions, Law} → controls → {Social_Control, Formal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of formal_Social_Control_ID000002: 
Formal social control refers to the mechanisms and processes used by authorised agents and institutions within society to maintain order, enforce laws, and ensure conformity to established norms and rules. These agents include police officers, judges, school administrators, employers, and other individuals who have been given the authority to enforce social norms and impose sanctions when violations occur. Formal social control is characterised by its reliance on written rules, laws, and regulations, as well as established procedures for identifying and punishing deviant behaviour. Examples of formal social control mechanisms include arrests, prosecutions, disciplinary actions, and legal penalties. It plays a crucial role in maintaining social stability and protecting societal values and interests, often working in conjunction with informal social control mechanisms, such as social disapproval and peer pressure.

Causal relation: {Racism, Gender_Inequality} → discriminatesAgainst → {Social_Exclusion, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of racism_ID000002: 
Racism is the attribution of characteristics of superiority or inferiority to a population sharing certain physically inherited characteristics, often leading to prejudice, discrimination, and the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over others. It is a complex system of power and ideology that operates at individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels, based on the social construction of racial categories and the belief that these categories are biologically real and associated with distinct traits, abilities, or moral character. Racism can manifest as overt acts of discrimination and hate speech, as well as in more subtle forms of bias embedded in social structures, policies, and practices that perpetuate racial inequalities in areas such as education, employment, housing, and the criminal justice system. It is a pervasive and harmful social phenomenon with deep historical roots and lasting consequences for individuals and societies.

Causal relation: {Racism, Gender_Inequality} → discriminatesAgainst → {Social_Exclusion, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of gender_Inequality_ID000004: 
Gender inequality refers to the differences in the status, power, prestige, opportunities, and resources that women and men have in groups, collectivities, and societies. This inequality is often manifested in various forms, including disparities in economic opportunities and earnings (such as the gender pay gap), political representation and influence, access to education and healthcare, and social and cultural norms that privilege one gender over the other, typically men. Gender inequality is a pervasive issue across many societies, although its specific forms and extent can vary significantly across cultures and historical periods. Feminist theories in sociology aim to understand the social, cultural, and historical roots of gender inequality and to advocate for social change that promotes gender equality and justice.

Causal relation: {Racism, Gender_Inequality} → discriminatesAgainst → {Social_Exclusion, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of social_Exclusion_ID000003: 
Social exclusion is a complex and multidimensional process and outcome where individuals or groups are prevented from fully participating in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of the society in which they are located due to a combination of multiple and often intersecting deprivations. These deprivations can include lack of adequate income and resources, limited access to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and social support networks, as well as experiences of discrimination, marginalisation, and a lack of voice or power in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Social exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and a diminished sense of belonging, hindering individuals' ability to exercise their rights, fulfill their potential, and participate as full and valued members of society. Addressing social exclusion requires tackling the various interconnected factors that contribute to it through inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and social integration for all members of society.

Causal relation: {Racism, Gender_Inequality} → discriminatesAgainst → {Social_Exclusion, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of minority_Group_ID000003: 
A minority group is a group of people in a minority in a given society who, because of their distinct physical or cultural characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability, find themselves in situations of inequality or disadvantage within that society. Membership in a minority group is typically ascribed rather than achieved, and these groups often experience discrimination, prejudice, and limited access to power and resources compared to the dominant or majority group. The term "minority" in this sociological context does not necessarily refer to a group's numerical size but rather to its subordinate status and lack of social, economic, and political power. Minority groups often develop a strong sense of group solidarity and shared identity in response to their experiences of marginalisation.

Causal relation: {Institutional_Discrimination, Racism} → discriminatesAgainst → {Ethnic_Group, Racial_Group}

Semantical explanation of institutional_Discrimination_ID000002: 
Institutional discrimination refers to the denial of opportunities and equal rights to individuals and groups that results from the normal operations of a society's institutions, such as schools, workplaces, healthcare systems, and the legal system, rather than from overt acts of individual prejudice. This form of discrimination is often embedded in established policies, procedures, and practices that may appear neutral on the surface but systematically disadvantage certain groups based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. For example, standardised testing in education that is culturally biased may disproportionately disadvantage students from certain minority groups, limiting their access to higher education. Similarly, hiring practices that rely heavily on personal networks may exclude qualified candidates who lack connections to the dominant group within an industry. Institutional discrimination can be subtle and often unintentional, but its cumulative effect can be significant in perpetuating social inequalities.

Causal relation: {Institutional_Discrimination, Racism} → discriminatesAgainst → {Ethnic_Group, Racial_Group}

Semantical explanation of ethnic_Group_ID000002: 
An ethnic group is a group of people who are set apart from others because of their shared national origin or distinctive cultural patterns, which can include language, religion, traditions, customs, and shared history. Members of an ethnic group typically share a sense of common identity and belonging based on these cultural elements, which distinguish them from other groups in society. Ethnicity is a social construct, meaning that it is defined and maintained through social interaction and cultural practices rather than being based on fixed biological traits. The boundaries of ethnic groups can be fluid and may change over time due to factors such as migration, intermarriage, and social and political contexts. The study of ethnic groups is central to understanding cultural diversity, intergroup relations, and issues of identity and belonging in sociology.

Causal relation: {Institutional_Discrimination, Racism} → discriminatesAgainst → {Ethnic_Group, Racial_Group}

Semantical explanation of racial_Group_ID000002: 
A racial group is a category of people who are set apart from others within a society primarily because of obvious physical differences that are perceived as socially significant and are used to define group membership and often to justify differential treatment and social hierarchies. These perceived physical differences are not inherently meaningful but become socially significant when a society defines them as such and uses them as a basis for categorizing people and assigning them to different social positions, often leading to inequalities in power, privilege, and status. The concept of racial groups is closely tied to the social construction of race and the social processes of racialisation, where certain physical characteristics are imbued with social meaning and used to create racial categories that have real social consequences.

Causal relation: {Total_Institutions, Degradation_Ceremony} → resocialises → {Resocialisation, Identity}

Semantical explanation of total_Institutions_ID000001: 
Total institutions, a term popularised by sociologist Erving Goffman, refer to facilities such as asylums for the mentally ill, prisons, monasteries, military barracks, and boarding schools that exert a pervasive and encompassing influence on the lives of their residents by imposing a forcibly regulated system of existence in complete or near-complete isolation from the outside world. These institutions are characterised by a breakdown of the barriers separating the three spheres of life that are usually distinct: sleep, work, and play; all aspects of life are conducted in the same place and under the same single authority. Residents typically experience a loss of autonomy and personal identity as their daily routines are strictly controlled, and they are subjected to a uniform system of rules and regulations aimed at managing large groups of people within the confines of the institution. Goffman's analysis of total institutions highlighted the processes of resocialisation and the potential for the stripping away of former identities and the adoption of an institutional identity among residents.

Causal relation: {Total_Institutions, Degradation_Ceremony} → resocialises → {Resocialisation, Identity}

Semantical explanation of degradation_Ceremony_ID000001: 
A degradation ceremony is an aspect of the socialisation process within total institutions, such as prisons, military boot camps, and mental hospitals, in which people are subjected to humiliating rituals and procedures designed to strip away their existing identities and self-concepts. The purpose of these ceremonies is to break down the individual's sense of self and replace it with an identity that is more compliant with the rules and expectations of the institution. These rituals can involve public shaming, the confiscation of personal belongings, the assignment of dehumanizing labels, and the enforcement of strict rules and routines that leave little room for individual expression or autonomy. The degradation ceremony marks the individual's entry into the total institution and signals the beginning of their resocialisation into the institutional culture. By systematically undermining the individual's former identity, the institution aims to create a blank slate upon which a new, institutionally defined identity can be inscribed. This process is a key mechanism through which total institutions maintain control and order over their populations.

Causal relation: {Total_Institutions, Degradation_Ceremony} → resocialises → {Resocialisation, Identity}

Semantical explanation of resocialisation_ID000001: 
Resocialisation is a profound process of discarding former behaviour patterns, values, norms, and beliefs that were learned in previous socialisation experiences and accepting new ones as part of a significant transition or change in an individual's life circumstances or social roles. This process often occurs when individuals move into a new social environment with drastically different norms and expectations, such as entering a total institution like a prison or a military boot camp, converting to a new religion, or undergoing a major life change like retirement or becoming a parent. Resocialisation can involve both unlearning old behaviours that are no longer appropriate or functional in the new context and internalizing new ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that are required for successful adaptation to the new social environment.

Causal relation: {Total_Institutions, Degradation_Ceremony} → resocialises → {Resocialisation, Identity}

Semantical explanation of identity_ID000003: 
Identity refers to the distinctive characteristics of a person's character or the character of a group which relate to who they are and what is meaningful to them, providing a sense of self and belonging. Some of the main sources of identity include gender, encompassing social expectations of masculinity and femininity; sexual orientation, referring to patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction; nationality or ethnicity, based on shared cultural heritage, origin, and often language or religion; and social class, reflecting one's position in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Identity is not fixed but is fluid and can evolve over an individual's life course through interactions with others and within different social contexts. It shapes how individuals perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others, influencing their social interactions, opportunities, and experiences within society.

Causal relation: {Resocialisation, Total_Institutions} → governs → {Identity, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of social_Roles_ID000003: 
Social_Roles represents the organised system of behavioural expectations, positions, and identities that individuals occupy within social structures and through which social interaction is organised and regulated. This category encompasses the fundamental mechanisms through which societies organise human behaviour and social relationships, including both positions that individuals achieve through their actions and those that are ascribed based on characteristics beyond their control. The concept includes the hierarchical dimension of social positions through status systems and the specialised behavioural expectations associated with particular social positions. Gender roles represent culturally defined expectations based on sex categories, while the sick role exemplifies how societies organise responses to illness and health conditions. Master status refers to dominant identity categories that override other social positions in social interaction. The category captures how societies create and maintain social order through the assignment and performance of differentiated roles that coordinate individual behaviour with collective needs and expectations. These roles serve as bridges between individual identity and social structure, providing frameworks for social interaction, identity formation, and the reproduction of social patterns across time and social contexts.

Semantical explanation of interest_Group_ID000001: 
An interest group is a voluntary association of citizens who come together with the shared goal of attempting to influence public policy in their favour. These groups advocate for specific issues or the interests of their members by lobbying government officials, raising public awareness, and mobilizing support for their cause. Interest groups can represent a wide range of concerns, including economic interests (e.g., business associations, labor unions), social issues (e.g., environmental groups, civil rights organisations), and professional interests (e.g., medical associations, bar associations). They play a significant role in the political process by providing information to policymakers, contributing to political campaigns, and putting pressure on elected officials to support their agendas. The activities of interest groups are a key aspect of understanding how public policy is shaped and the various influences at play in democratic societies.

Causal relation: {Interest_Group, Political_Action_Committee_(PAC)} → advocates → {Political_System, Democracy}

Semantical explanation of political_Action_Committee_(PAC)_ID000002: 
A political action committee (PAC) is a political committee that is typically established by an interest groupâ€”such as a national bank, corporation, trade association, cooperative, or membership associationâ€”for the specific purpose of soliciting and distributing financial contributions to candidates running for political office or to political parties. PACs are a significant part of the campaign finance system in many democracies, allowing organised groups to pool resources and support candidates who align with their interests and policy objectives. The regulations governing PACs, including the amount of money they can raise and contribute, vary depending on the jurisdiction.

Semantical explanation of political_System_ID000003: 
A political system is the social institution within a society that relies on a recognised set of procedures and structures for implementing and achieving the collective goals of a group or society, particularly those related to power, authority, and governance. It encompasses the government, political parties, interest groups, and the broader political culture, including the norms, values, and beliefs that shape political behaviour and decision-making processes. The political system is responsible for making and enforcing rules, resolving conflicts, and allocating resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Interest_Group, Political_Action_Committee_(PAC)} → advocates → {Political_System, Democracy}

Semantical explanation of democracy_ID000004: 
Democracy is a political system in which power is exercised by the people as a whole, either directly or through elected representatives. Key principles of democracy typically include free and fair elections, the rule of law, protection of individual rights and freedoms (such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press), and the accountability of government to the people. Democratic systems can take various forms, such as parliamentary democracies, presidential democracies, and direct democracies, each with its own specific structures and processes for decision-making and governance. The concept of democracy is often associated with values such as equality, participation, and the consent of the governed. The spread and consolidation of democracy have been major themes in political sociology, with researchers studying the factors that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of democratic institutions around the world.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Transmission, Language} → preserves → {Culture, Values}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Transmission_ID000002: 
Cultural transmission is the process by which one generation passes culture to the next, ensuring the continuity of societal norms, values, beliefs, traditions, and practices. This process occurs through various mechanisms, including socialisation within the family, formal education in schools, informal learning from peers and community members, and exposure to media and cultural products. Language is a fundamental tool for cultural transmission, allowing for the communication of knowledge, history, and cultural values across generations. Traditions, rituals, and storytelling also play important roles in passing down cultural heritage. Cultural transmission is essential for the survival and development of societies, as it enables each new generation to learn from the experiences and knowledge of those who came before them, contributing to social stability and cultural evolution. The effectiveness of cultural transmission can influence the rate and direction of cultural change within a society.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Transmission, Language} → preserves → {Culture, Values}

Semantical explanation of language_ID000001: 
Language is an abstract and complex system of word meanings, symbols, and rules (grammar) that are shared by members of a culture and used for communication and representing all aspects of that culture. It is not limited to spoken or written words but also includes gestures, facial expressions, and other forms of nonverbal communication that convey meaning within a social context. Language is fundamental to human interaction, social organisation, and the transmission of culture from one generation to the next. It shapes how we think, perceive the world, and construct our social reality. The diversity of human languages reflects the rich tapestry of human cultures and the different ways in which societies have developed to understand and interact with their environments.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Transmission, Language} → preserves → {Culture, Values}

Semantical explanation of culture_ID000007: 
Culture encompasses the values, beliefs, ceremonies, ways of life, norms, symbols, and material goods characteristic of a given group or society. Like the concept of society, the notion of culture is very widely used in sociology, as well as in other social sciences, particularly anthropology. Culture is one of the most distinctive properties of human social association, differentiating human societies from animal societies in its complexity and transmission through learning rather than solely through instinct. It includes everything that is learned and shared by the members of a society, shaping their behaviour and their understanding of the world. Culture can be broadly divided into material culture, which includes tangible objects created by a society (such as tools, technology, clothing, and art), and nonmaterial culture, which includes intangible aspects such as ideas, values, beliefs, norms, language, and social institutions. Culture provides a framework for social interaction, defines what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and gives meaning to people's lives. It is dynamic and constantly evolving through processes of innovation, diffusion, and adaptation.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Transmission, Language} → preserves → {Culture, Values}

Semantical explanation of values_ID000004: 
Values are culturally defined standards or principles that are widely shared by members of a society or group and serve as broad guidelines for social living, indicating what people assess as desirable, good, beautiful, right, or important. Values provide a moral compass for behaviour, influencing people's attitudes, choices, and actions across various aspects of life, and they often form the basis for social norms, which are more specific rules and expectations for behaviour. Values can vary significantly across different cultures and can change over time within a society, reflecting evolving beliefs and priorities. They play a crucial role in shaping social cohesion, cultural identity, and the overall character of a society, and they are often transmitted from one generation to the next through the process of socialisation.

Semantical explanation of primary_Socialisation_ID000001: 
Primary socialisation is the fundamental process by which children learn the basic cultural norms, values, beliefs, language, and behaviours of the society into which they are born, primarily occurring within the family and close-knit social environments during their early years. Through interaction with primary caregivers and other close family members, children develop their initial sense of self, learn how to communicate, and internalise the foundational norms and expectations of their culture, which are essential for functioning within that society. This stage of socialisation lays the groundwork for future learning and social development.

Semantical explanation of family_ID000005: 
A family is a group of individuals related to one another by blood ties, marriage, or adoption who form an economic unit, the adult members of which are responsible for the upbringing of children. All known societies involve some form of family system, although the nature of family relationships is widely variable across cultures and throughout history. While in modern societies the main family form is often considered the nuclear family (a couple and their dependent children), a variety of extended family relationships (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) are also frequently found and play important roles in individuals' lives. The family serves as a primary agent of socialisation, providing emotional support, care, and a sense of belonging for its members. It also plays a crucial role in the transmission of cultural norms, values, and traditions across generations.

Semantical explanation of internet_ID000006: 
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that allows people to communicate with one another and find information on the Worldwide Web by exchanging data in various forms, including visuals, sounds, and text. This vast network operates in a way that largely transcends the limitations of time, physical space, and the traditional costs and control mechanisms associated with distance and territorial governments. The Internet has become an indispensable tool for communication, education, commerce, entertainment, and social interaction, connecting billions of people around the world and providing access to an unprecedented amount of information and resources. Its decentralised nature and open architecture have fostered innovation and the rapid development of new technologies and applications, transforming many aspects of modern life and contributing to the phenomenon of globalisation.

Causal relation: {Internet} → hasInfluence → {Organised_Crime}

Semantical explanation of organised_Crime_ID000001: 
Organised crime refers to the work of a group or network of individuals who engage in illegal activities on an ongoing basis, often regulating relations between various criminal enterprises involved in areas such as the smuggling and sale of drugs, prostitution, gambling, extortion, and other illicit activities for profit. These groups typically have a hierarchical structure, rules of conduct, and may use violence, corruption, and intimidation to maintain their power and control over their criminal operations. Organised crime can have significant social and economic consequences, undermining legitimate businesses, corrupting public officials, and contributing to violence and instability in communities.

Causal relation: {Labeling_Theory, Stigma} → stigmatises → {Deviance, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of labeling_Theory_ID000001: 
Labeling theory is a sociological approach to understanding deviance that attempts to explain why certain people are viewed and treated as deviants while others engaging in the same behaviour are not. This theory emphasises the role of social reaction and the application of labels in the creation of deviance. It suggests that deviance is not inherent in an act itself but rather is a social construct defined by how society responds to certain behaviours and individuals. When individuals are labeled as deviant by political authorities or other influential groups, this label can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to further deviant behaviour as the labeled individuals internalise the label and are treated accordingly by others. Labeling theory highlights the power of social definitions and the consequences of being labeled as deviant for an individual's identity and life chances.

Causal relation: {Labeling_Theory, Stigma} → stigmatises → {Deviance, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of stigma_ID000001: 
Stigma refers to a negative label, mark of disgrace, or social disapproval that is used to devalue members of deviant social groups or individuals who possess certain characteristics or attributes that are seen as undesirable or different from the prevailing social norms. A stigma can be attached to various conditions, behaviours, or identities, such as mental illness, criminal history, physical disabilities, certain lifestyles, or membership in particular social groups. The process of stigmatisation can lead to social exclusion, discrimination, prejudice, and a loss of social status for the stigmatised individuals or groups, often impacting their self-esteem, social interactions, and opportunities in life. Labeling theory in sociology highlights the role of stigma in the social construction of deviance and its consequences for those who are labeled.

Causal relation: {Labeling_Theory, Stigma} → stigmatises → {Deviance, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of deviance_ID000003: 
Deviance refers to behaviour that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society. What is considered deviant varies across cultures, social groups, and time periods, as it is defined by social norms and values. Deviant behaviour can range from minor infractions of social norms to serious violations of laws. Sociologists study deviance to understand why people violate norms, how societies react to deviance, and the role of deviance in social change. Various theories attempt to explain deviance, including anomie theory, differential association theory, control theory, and labeling theory. Deviance is not inherently negative; while some deviant acts are harmful, others can challenge existing norms and lead to social progress.

Causal relation: {Labeling_Theory, Stigma} → stigmatises → {Deviance, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of social_Exclusion_ID000004: 
Social exclusion is a complex and multidimensional process and outcome where individuals or groups are prevented from fully participating in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of the society in which they are located due to a combination of multiple and often intersecting deprivations. These deprivations can include lack of adequate income and resources, limited access to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and social support networks, as well as experiences of discrimination, marginalisation, and a lack of voice or power in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Social exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and a diminished sense of belonging, hindering individuals' ability to exercise their rights, fulfill their potential, and participate as full and valued members of society. Addressing social exclusion requires tackling the various interconnected factors that contribute to it through inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and social integration for all members of society.

Causal relation: {Multinational_Corporations, Bureaucracy} → employs → {Working_Class, Proletariat}

Semantical explanation of multinational_Corporations_ID000005: 
Multinational corporations (MNCs) are large commercial organisations that are headquartered in one country (the home country) but conduct business operations, including production, marketing, sales, and research and development, in numerous other countries around the world (host countries). These corporations often have significant economic power and play a major role in the global economy through foreign direct investment, international trade, and the transfer of technology and capital across borders. MNCs can have both positive and negative impacts on the countries in which they operate, providing jobs and investment but also potentially raising issues related to labor practices, environmental regulations, and economic sovereignty. The study of multinational corporations is an important area in sociology, particularly in the context of globalisation and its effects on national economies and societies.

Semantical explanation of bureaucracy_ID000004: 
Bureaucracy is an organisation of a hierarchical sort, which takes the form of a pyramid of authority, with clear lines of command and responsibility. The term 'bureaucracy' was popularised by Max Weber, who considered it the most efficient type of large-scale human organisation in modern society. According to Weber, bureaucracy is characterised by a division of labor, a clearly defined hierarchy, formal rules and regulations, impersonality, and a focus on technical competence. As organisations grow in size and complexity, Weber argued, they inevitably tend to become more and more bureaucratised to manage their operations effectively.

Causal relation: {Multinational_Corporations, Bureaucracy} → employs → {Working_Class, Proletariat}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000011: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Semantical explanation of proletariat_ID000005: 
Proletariat, in the theoretical framework of Karl Marx, refers to the working class in a capitalist society who do not own the means of production (such as factories, land, and capital) and must therefore sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class who own the means of production) in order to earn a living and survive. According to Marx, the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie, who extract surplus value from their labor in the form of profit, leading to inherent class conflict and the potential for the proletariat to develop class consciousness and ultimately overthrow the capitalist system.

Labour unions are formal organisations of workers who come together to collectively seek to improve their wages, working conditions, benefits, and job security through various strategies, including negotiation with employers (collective bargaining) and the use of tactics such as strikes when necessary. Unions provide a collective voice for workers, aiming to balance the power dynamic between individual employees and employers. They advocate for workers' rights, fair treatment, and safer workplaces. The history and influence of labour unions have played a significant role in shaping labor laws, workplace standards, and the overall distribution of economic power in many countries.

Trade unions, also known as labor unions, are organisations formed by workers in a specific trade, industry, or company with the primary purpose of maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment. These conditions typically include attaining better wages and benefits, improving working conditions, and enhancing safety standards in the workplace. Trade unions operate through elected leadership and bargaining committees that negotiate with employers on behalf of their members in a process known as collective bargaining, aiming to establish labor contracts or collective bargaining agreements that outline the terms of employment. Unions may organise workers based on their specific skills (craft unionism), across various trades (general unionism), or within an entire industry (industrial unionism). Historically, trade unions emerged in response to the often precarious and exploitative conditions faced by workers, particularly during the Industrial Revolution, providing a collective voice and power to negotiate for fairer treatment and improved livelihoods. They have played a significant role in advocating for workers' rights, safer workplaces, and the end of child labor, often operating with a democratic structure where members elect officers and pay dues to support the union's activities.

Causal relation: {Labour_Unions, Trade_Unions} → protests → {Strike, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of strike_ID000001: 
A strike is a temporary stoppage of work or a collective withdrawal of labor by a group of workers or employees from their workplace as a form of protest or to exert pressure on their employer to meet specific demands or grievances, such as for better wages, improved working conditions, job security, or other employment-related issues. Strikes are a key tactic used by labor unions as part of collective bargaining to negotiate with employers and advocate for the rights and interests of their members. The decision to strike is often a significant one, involving a collective vote by union members, and it can have economic and social consequences for both the workers and the employer.

Causal relation: {Labour_Unions, Trade_Unions} → protests → {Strike, Working_Class}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000012: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Labour unions are formal organisations of workers who come together to collectively seek to improve their wages, working conditions, benefits, and job security through various strategies, including negotiation with employers (collective bargaining) and the use of tactics such as strikes when necessary. Unions provide a collective voice for workers, aiming to balance the power dynamic between individual employees and employers. They advocate for workers' rights, fair treatment, and safer workplaces. The history and influence of labour unions have played a significant role in shaping labor laws, workplace standards, and the overall distribution of economic power in many countries.

Semantical explanation of capitalism_ID000010: 
Capitalism is a system of economic enterprise based on market exchange, private ownership of the means of production, and the pursuit of profit. 'Capital' refers to any asset, including money, property, and machines, which can be used to produce commodities for sale or invested in a market with the hope of achieving a profit. Key features of capitalism include free markets, competition, wage labor, and the accumulation of capital. While it can drive innovation and economic growth, capitalism has also been criticised for its potential to create social inequalities and economic instability. Karl Marx argued that capitalism leads to alienation of workers from their labor and the products they produce.

Semantical explanation of bourgeoisie_ID000005: 
Bourgeoisie, in the theory of Karl Marx, refers to the capitalist class, comprising the owners of the means of production, such as factories, land, and capital. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie stands in opposition to the proletariat, or working class, who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie in order to survive.[1, 2] According to Marx, the bourgeoisie's primary goal is the accumulation of capital and profit, which they achieve through the exploitation of the proletariat. This class structure and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are central to Marx's critique of capitalism.

Law refers to governmental social control, representing a formal system of rules and regulations enacted and enforced by political authorities to govern behaviour and maintain social order within a society. Laws are typically written down and specify both the behaviours that are prohibited or required and the sanctions or penalties that will be applied when violations occur. The legal system includes various institutions, such as legislatures that create laws, law enforcement agencies that enforce them, and courts that interpret laws and adjudicate disputes. Law plays a crucial role in establishing norms, resolving conflicts, protecting rights, and providing a framework for social interaction in complex societies. The legitimacy and effectiveness of law depend on its acceptance by the people it governs and its consistent and fair application.

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000004: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Semantical explanation of formal_Social_Control_ID000003: 
Formal social control refers to the mechanisms and processes used by authorised agents and institutions within society to maintain order, enforce laws, and ensure conformity to established norms and rules. These agents include police officers, judges, school administrators, employers, and other individuals who have been given the authority to enforce social norms and impose sanctions when violations occur. Formal social control is characterised by its reliance on written rules, laws, and regulations, as well as established procedures for identifying and punishing deviant behaviour. Examples of formal social control mechanisms include arrests, prosecutions, disciplinary actions, and legal penalties. It plays a crucial role in maintaining social stability and protecting societal values and interests, often working in conjunction with informal social control mechanisms, such as social disapproval and peer pressure.

Causal relation: {Law, Formal_Social_Control} → regulates → {Crime, Deviance}

Semantical explanation of crime_ID000003: 
Crime is a violation of criminal law for which formal penalties are applied by some governmental authority. What constitutes a crime is defined by legal statutes at the local, state, or federal level, and these definitions can vary across jurisdictions and change over time. Crimes are typically classified based on their severity, ranging from minor offenses (misdemeanors) to serious felonies. The criminal justice system, including law enforcement agencies, courts, and correctional institutions, is responsible for enforcing criminal laws, apprehending offenders, and administering penalties, which can include fines, probation, imprisonment, or, in some cases, capital punishment. Sociologists study crime from various perspectives, examining its social causes, patterns, and consequences, as well as the functioning of the criminal justice system and its impact on society.

Causal relation: {Law, Formal_Social_Control} → regulates → {Crime, Deviance}

Semantical explanation of deviance_ID000004: 
Deviance refers to behaviour that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society. What is considered deviant varies across cultures, social groups, and time periods, as it is defined by social norms and values. Deviant behaviour can range from minor infractions of social norms to serious violations of laws. Sociologists study deviance to understand why people violate norms, how societies react to deviance, and the role of deviance in social change. Various theories attempt to explain deviance, including anomie theory, differential association theory, control theory, and labeling theory. Deviance is not inherently negative; while some deviant acts are harmful, others can challenge existing norms and lead to social progress.

Semantical explanation of capitalism_ID000011: 
Capitalism is a system of economic enterprise based on market exchange, private ownership of the means of production, and the pursuit of profit. 'Capital' refers to any asset, including money, property, and machines, which can be used to produce commodities for sale or invested in a market with the hope of achieving a profit. Key features of capitalism include free markets, competition, wage labor, and the accumulation of capital. While it can drive innovation and economic growth, capitalism has also been criticised for its potential to create social inequalities and economic instability. Karl Marx argued that capitalism leads to alienation of workers from their labor and the products they produce.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Economy} → controls → {Economic_System, Laissez-faire}

Semantical explanation of economy_ID000007: 
The economy refers to the system of production and exchange which provides for the material needs of individuals living in a given society. It encompasses all activities related to the creation, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The economy is a fundamental aspect of social life, as it shapes how people earn a living, access resources, and interact with one another in the process of fulfilling their material needs and wants. The structure and functioning of the economy are influenced by a complex interplay of social, cultural, political, and technological factors. Sociologists study the economy to understand its impact on social inequality, social mobility, work, and other aspects of social life. Different types of economies, such as agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial economies, have distinct characteristics and social consequences.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Economy} → controls → {Economic_System, Laissez-faire}

Semantical explanation of economic_System_ID000011: 
An economic system is the social institution through which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed within a society. It encompasses the organisational arrangements, rules, and practices that govern how a society allocates its resources to satisfy the needs and wants of its members. Different societies have adopted various types of economic systems throughout history, including traditional economies, command economies, market economies (capitalism), and mixed economies that combine elements of different systems. Each type of economic system has its own set of principles regarding ownership of resources, decision-making processes, and mechanisms for production, distribution, and consumption. The dominant economic system in a society has a profound impact on its social structure, levels of inequality, and the daily lives of its people.

Causal relation: {Capitalism, Economy} → controls → {Economic_System, Laissez-faire}

Semantical explanation of laissez-faire_ID000001: 
Laissez-faire is a specific form of capitalism under which individuals and businesses compete freely in the marketplace with minimal or no government intervention in the economy. This economic philosophy advocates for a separation of the state from economic affairs, believing that the natural forces of supply and demand, driven by self-interest and competition, will lead to the most efficient allocation of resources and the greatest overall prosperity. In a pure laissez-faire system, the role of government is typically limited to enforcing contracts, protecting private property rights, and maintaining peace and order, without imposing regulations, tariffs, subsidies, or other forms of economic control. The idea is that the "invisible hand" of the market will guide economic activity more effectively than state intervention. While no modern economy operates under a completely laissez-faire system, it remains an influential theoretical model in economic and political thought.

Semantical explanation of mass_Media_ID000003: 
Mass media refers to forms of communication, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television, films, and the internet, that are designed to reach and influence very large audiences, often simultaneously. These media play a significant role in shaping public opinion, disseminating information, transmitting cultural values and norms, and providing entertainment. The development and widespread availability of mass media have had a profound impact on society, influencing everything from political campaigns and consumer behaviour to popular culture and social movements. Sociologists study mass media to understand its effects on individuals and society, including issues related to media ownership, content, audience reception, and the role of media in shaping social identities and perceptions of reality. The rise of digital and social media has further transformed the landscape of mass communication, creating new opportunities and challenges for how information is produced, distributed, and consumed.

Semantical explanation of multimedia_ID000001: 
Multimedia refers to the combination of what used to be different media formats, requiring different technologies for access and presentation (for instance, visuals, audio, text, video, and interactive elements), integrated onto a single medium or platform, such as a CD-ROM, DVD, website, or computer application, which can be accessed and experienced using a computer or other digital device. This integration allows for a richer and more engaging user experience by combining various forms of content in a cohesive and interactive way. The rise of digital technologies has greatly facilitated the creation and distribution of multimedia content, transforming how information is communicated, entertainment is consumed, and learning takes place.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Multimedia} → communicatesWith → {Public_Sphere, Media_And_Communication}

Semantical explanation of public_Sphere_ID000001: 
The public sphere is a concept associated with the German sociologist JÃ¼rgen Habermas, referring to the arena of public debate and discussion in modern societies where individuals can come together to freely discuss and form opinions about matters of general interest and concern, ideally independent of state control or economic pressures. Habermas envisioned the public sphere as a space for rational-critical discourse, where citizens could exchange ideas, critique power structures, and participate in the formation of public opinion, which could then influence political action and policy-making. This sphere is not necessarily a physical place but rather a discursive space that can exist in various forms, such as through media, public gatherings, and online platforms, where reasoned arguments and open dialogue are central to the process of shaping collective understanding and political will. The ideal of the public sphere emphasises accessibility, inclusivity, and the free exchange of ideas among informed citizens.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Multimedia} → communicatesWith → {Public_Sphere, Media_And_Communication}

Semantical explanation of media_And_Communication_ID000001: 
Media and Communication is a broad sociological domain that systematically studies the diverse means, processes, and effects through which information, ideas, and messages are produced, disseminated, and received within society, and their profound impact on individuals, social groups, and social structures. This field encompasses various forms of mass media (e.g., television, radio, newspapers, film), digital media (e.g., the internet, cyberspace, multimedia, social media), and telecommunications. It examines how communication technologies shape social interaction (e.g., non-verbal communication, semiotics), the construction of meaning, and the formation of public opinion. The domain also analyses media texts (media products), media industries, media consumption patterns, and the role of communication in cultural transmission, social change, political processes, and the perpetuation or challenge of social inequalities. It delves into topics such as media ownership, content analysis, communication flows, and the digital divide, highlighting the pervasive influence of media in contemporary social life.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media} → hasInfluence → {Public_Sphere}

Semantical explanation of public_Sphere_ID000002: 
The public sphere is a concept associated with the German sociologist JÃ¼rgen Habermas, referring to the arena of public debate and discussion in modern societies where individuals can come together to freely discuss and form opinions about matters of general interest and concern, ideally independent of state control or economic pressures. Habermas envisioned the public sphere as a space for rational-critical discourse, where citizens could exchange ideas, critique power structures, and participate in the formation of public opinion, which could then influence political action and policy-making. This sphere is not necessarily a physical place but rather a discursive space that can exist in various forms, such as through media, public gatherings, and online platforms, where reasoned arguments and open dialogue are central to the process of shaping collective understanding and political will. The ideal of the public sphere emphasises accessibility, inclusivity, and the free exchange of ideas among informed citizens.

Semantical explanation of mass_Media_ID000005: 
Mass media refers to forms of communication, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television, films, and the internet, that are designed to reach and influence very large audiences, often simultaneously. These media play a significant role in shaping public opinion, disseminating information, transmitting cultural values and norms, and providing entertainment. The development and widespread availability of mass media have had a profound impact on society, influencing everything from political campaigns and consumer behaviour to popular culture and social movements. Sociologists study mass media to understand its effects on individuals and society, including issues related to media ownership, content, audience reception, and the role of media in shaping social identities and perceptions of reality. The rise of digital and social media has further transformed the landscape of mass communication, creating new opportunities and challenges for how information is produced, distributed, and consumed.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Media_And_Communication} → influencesHistorically → {Political_Ideologies_And_Movements, Political_System}

Semantical explanation of media_And_Communication_ID000002: 
Media and Communication is a broad sociological domain that systematically studies the diverse means, processes, and effects through which information, ideas, and messages are produced, disseminated, and received within society, and their profound impact on individuals, social groups, and social structures. This field encompasses various forms of mass media (e.g., television, radio, newspapers, film), digital media (e.g., the internet, cyberspace, multimedia, social media), and telecommunications. It examines how communication technologies shape social interaction (e.g., non-verbal communication, semiotics), the construction of meaning, and the formation of public opinion. The domain also analyses media texts (media products), media industries, media consumption patterns, and the role of communication in cultural transmission, social change, political processes, and the perpetuation or challenge of social inequalities. It delves into topics such as media ownership, content analysis, communication flows, and the digital divide, highlighting the pervasive influence of media in contemporary social life.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Media_And_Communication} → influencesHistorically → {Political_Ideologies_And_Movements, Political_System}

Semantical explanation of political_Ideologies_And_Movements_ID000001: 
Political_Ideologies_And_Movements represents organised belief systems, value frameworks, and collective action initiatives that seek to shape political discourse, influence policy outcomes, and transform social and economic arrangements. This category encompasses both systematic ideological frameworks that provide comprehensive worldviews and organised movements that mobilise collective action around specific goals or grievances. These entities function as realizable potentials that can be activated under appropriate social and political conditions, manifesting in political campaigns, policy reforms, institutional changes, and social transformation. Ideological frameworks provide coherent sets of beliefs about how society should be organised, the proper role of government, and the relationship between individual freedom and collective welfare. Social movements represent organised efforts to challenge existing power structures, advocate for marginalised groups, or promote alternative visions of social organisation. The category recognises that political change emerges from the dynamic interaction between ideas and organised action, with movements serving as vehicles for translating ideological commitments into concrete political outcomes and policy changes.

Semantical explanation of political_System_ID000004: 
A political system is the social institution within a society that relies on a recognised set of procedures and structures for implementing and achieving the collective goals of a group or society, particularly those related to power, authority, and governance. It encompasses the government, political parties, interest groups, and the broader political culture, including the norms, values, and beliefs that shape political behaviour and decision-making processes. The political system is responsible for making and enforcing rules, resolving conflicts, and allocating resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Crime} → influencesHistorically → {Social_Control, Deviance}

Semantical explanation of crime_ID000004: 
Crime is a violation of criminal law for which formal penalties are applied by some governmental authority. What constitutes a crime is defined by legal statutes at the local, state, or federal level, and these definitions can vary across jurisdictions and change over time. Crimes are typically classified based on their severity, ranging from minor offenses (misdemeanors) to serious felonies. The criminal justice system, including law enforcement agencies, courts, and correctional institutions, is responsible for enforcing criminal laws, apprehending offenders, and administering penalties, which can include fines, probation, imprisonment, or, in some cases, capital punishment. Sociologists study crime from various perspectives, examining its social causes, patterns, and consequences, as well as the functioning of the criminal justice system and its impact on society.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Crime} → influencesHistorically → {Social_Control, Deviance}

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000005: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Crime} → influencesHistorically → {Social_Control, Deviance}

Semantical explanation of deviance_ID000005: 
Deviance refers to behaviour that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society. What is considered deviant varies across cultures, social groups, and time periods, as it is defined by social norms and values. Deviant behaviour can range from minor infractions of social norms to serious violations of laws. Sociologists study deviance to understand why people violate norms, how societies react to deviance, and the role of deviance in social change. Various theories attempt to explain deviance, including anomie theory, differential association theory, control theory, and labeling theory. Deviance is not inherently negative; while some deviant acts are harmful, others can challenge existing norms and lead to social progress.

Semantical explanation of peer_Group_ID000001: 
A peer group is a social group whose members share common characteristics such as similar interests, social position, age, and often a sense of shared identity and belonging. Peer groups play a significant role in the socialisation process, particularly during adolescence, influencing individuals' attitudes, values, behaviours, and self-concept. They provide a context for learning social skills, developing relationships, and establishing norms and expectations that may differ from those of the family or broader society. Peer influence can be strong, shaping choices related to fashion, music, activities, and even academic performance. Peer groups can provide social support and a sense of community, but they can also exert pressure to conform to group norms, sometimes in ways that may be positive or negative for the individual.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Peer_Group, Youth_Culture} → hasInfluence → {Fashion, Culture}

Semantical explanation of youth_Culture_ID000001: 
Youth culture refers to the specific cultural attributes, norms, values, practices, styles, and forms of expression exhibited by many young people within a particular period or society, often characterised by a sense of shared identity, interests, and experiences that are distinct from those of other age groups, particularly adults. Youth culture can manifest in various aspects of life, including behavioural norms, dress codes, language use (such as slang), musical preferences, leisure activities, and attitudes towards social issues, many of which tend to differ from the prevailing adult culture of the time and may even represent a form of rebellion or a search for autonomy and identity formation during the transitional period of adolescence and young adulthood. Youth cultures are dynamic and can change rapidly, often influenced by popular media, technology, and social trends, and they can play a significant role in shaping broader cultural landscapes and driving social change.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Peer_Group, Youth_Culture} → hasInfluence → {Fashion, Culture}

Semantical explanation of fashion_ID000001: 
Fashion refers to a social pattern in clothing, accessories, footwear, hairstyles, or behaviour that is favoured for a time by a large number of people within a particular culture or subculture. It is a dynamic and ever-changing phenomenon influenced by social, cultural, economic, and technological factors. Fashion can reflect current trends, social status, and individual identity, and it often involves a process of adoption, diffusion, and eventual obsolescence as new styles emerge. It is a form of collective behaviour that can be driven by designers, celebrities, media, and peer influence. The study of fashion in sociology examines its role in social differentiation, group affiliation, and the expression of cultural values. Trends in fashion can spread rapidly through modern communication channels, creating a sense of shared identity among those who adopt them.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Peer_Group, Youth_Culture} → hasInfluence → {Fashion, Culture}

Semantical explanation of culture_ID000008: 
Culture encompasses the values, beliefs, ceremonies, ways of life, norms, symbols, and material goods characteristic of a given group or society. Like the concept of society, the notion of culture is very widely used in sociology, as well as in other social sciences, particularly anthropology. Culture is one of the most distinctive properties of human social association, differentiating human societies from animal societies in its complexity and transmission through learning rather than solely through instinct. It includes everything that is learned and shared by the members of a society, shaping their behaviour and their understanding of the world. Culture can be broadly divided into material culture, which includes tangible objects created by a society (such as tools, technology, clothing, and art), and nonmaterial culture, which includes intangible aspects such as ideas, values, beliefs, norms, language, and social institutions. Culture provides a framework for social interaction, defines what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and gives meaning to people's lives. It is dynamic and constantly evolving through processes of innovation, diffusion, and adaptation.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Media_Texts} → hasInfluence → {Public_Sphere, Politics}

Semantical explanation of mass_Media_ID000008: 
Mass media refers to forms of communication, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television, films, and the internet, that are designed to reach and influence very large audiences, often simultaneously. These media play a significant role in shaping public opinion, disseminating information, transmitting cultural values and norms, and providing entertainment. The development and widespread availability of mass media have had a profound impact on society, influencing everything from political campaigns and consumer behaviour to popular culture and social movements. Sociologists study mass media to understand its effects on individuals and society, including issues related to media ownership, content, audience reception, and the role of media in shaping social identities and perceptions of reality. The rise of digital and social media has further transformed the landscape of mass communication, creating new opportunities and challenges for how information is produced, distributed, and consumed.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Media_Texts} → hasInfluence → {Public_Sphere, Politics}

Semantical explanation of media_Texts_ID000001: 
Media texts encompass all forms of media products, including television programmes, films, CDs, books, newspapers, website pages, social media posts, and advertisements, which are created and disseminated to communicate information, ideas, entertainment, or persuasion to an audience. These texts are not simply neutral carriers of information but are constructed with specific intentions and can be analysed for their content, form, audience, and the social, cultural, and political messages they convey. The study of media texts involves examining their production, distribution, and consumption, as well as their potential effects on individuals and society. Understanding media texts is crucial in sociology for analysing how media shapes our perceptions of the world, influences our beliefs and values, and contributes to the construction of social reality.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Media_Texts} → hasInfluence → {Public_Sphere, Politics}

Semantical explanation of public_Sphere_ID000003: 
The public sphere is a concept associated with the German sociologist JÃ¼rgen Habermas, referring to the arena of public debate and discussion in modern societies where individuals can come together to freely discuss and form opinions about matters of general interest and concern, ideally independent of state control or economic pressures. Habermas envisioned the public sphere as a space for rational-critical discourse, where citizens could exchange ideas, critique power structures, and participate in the formation of public opinion, which could then influence political action and policy-making. This sphere is not necessarily a physical place but rather a discursive space that can exist in various forms, such as through media, public gatherings, and online platforms, where reasoned arguments and open dialogue are central to the process of shaping collective understanding and political will. The ideal of the public sphere emphasises accessibility, inclusivity, and the free exchange of ideas among informed citizens.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Media_Texts} → hasInfluence → {Public_Sphere, Politics}

Semantical explanation of politics_ID000005: 
Politics, in Harold D. Lasswell's classic definition, is fundamentally about "who gets what, when, and how," highlighting the struggle for power and resources within a society and the processes through which decisions are made about their distribution and allocation. It involves the exercise of power and influence to shape policies, make collective decisions, and resolve conflicts over competing interests and values. Politics operates at various levels, from interpersonal relationships and small groups to national and international arenas, and is a central aspect of social organisation and governance.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Power_Elite} → controls → {Public_Sphere, Hegemony}

Semantical explanation of mass_Media_ID000010: 
Mass media refers to forms of communication, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television, films, and the internet, that are designed to reach and influence very large audiences, often simultaneously. These media play a significant role in shaping public opinion, disseminating information, transmitting cultural values and norms, and providing entertainment. The development and widespread availability of mass media have had a profound impact on society, influencing everything from political campaigns and consumer behaviour to popular culture and social movements. Sociologists study mass media to understand its effects on individuals and society, including issues related to media ownership, content, audience reception, and the role of media in shaping social identities and perceptions of reality. The rise of digital and social media has further transformed the landscape of mass communication, creating new opportunities and challenges for how information is produced, distributed, and consumed.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Power_Elite} → controls → {Public_Sphere, Hegemony}

Semantical explanation of power_Elite_ID000003: 
Power elite is a term popularised by sociologist C. Wright Mills to describe a relatively small, tightly knit group of individuals who occupy the top positions in the dominant institutions of American societyâ€”namely, the military, the industrial (corporate) sector, and the governmentâ€”and who collectively hold the most power and make key decisions that shape the fate of the United States. According to Mills, these elites share similar backgrounds, interests, and worldviews, and their decisions have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the population, often operating outside of traditional democratic processes and accountability. The theory of the power elite suggests that power in modern industrial societies is concentrated rather than widely dispersed.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Power_Elite} → controls → {Public_Sphere, Hegemony}

Semantical explanation of public_Sphere_ID000005: 
The public sphere is a concept associated with the German sociologist JÃ¼rgen Habermas, referring to the arena of public debate and discussion in modern societies where individuals can come together to freely discuss and form opinions about matters of general interest and concern, ideally independent of state control or economic pressures. Habermas envisioned the public sphere as a space for rational-critical discourse, where citizens could exchange ideas, critique power structures, and participate in the formation of public opinion, which could then influence political action and policy-making. This sphere is not necessarily a physical place but rather a discursive space that can exist in various forms, such as through media, public gatherings, and online platforms, where reasoned arguments and open dialogue are central to the process of shaping collective understanding and political will. The ideal of the public sphere emphasises accessibility, inclusivity, and the free exchange of ideas among informed citizens.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Power_Elite} → controls → {Public_Sphere, Hegemony}

Semantical explanation of hegemony_ID000002: 
Hegemony, in a sociological context, refers to the means by which a ruling or dominant group wins over a subordinate group through ideas, values, beliefs, and cultural norms, rather than primarily through force or coercion. This concept, often associated with the work of Antonio Gramsci, describes a process where the dominant group's ideology becomes widely accepted as common sense or the natural order of things, even by those who are disadvantaged by it, thereby maintaining the dominant group's power and control. Hegemony operates by shaping people's perceptions, preferences, and understandings of the world in ways that support the status quo. It is a subtle form of power that works through cultural influence and the shaping of consciousness, making social inequalities seem legitimate or inevitable.

Causal relation: {Migration, Population} → influencesHistorically → {Urbanism, Cultural_Diversity}

Semantical explanation of migration_ID000003: 
Migration refers to the movement of people into and out of a particular territory, which can occur within a country (internal migration) or across national borders (international migration). This movement can be temporary or permanent and can be driven by a variety of factors, including economic opportunities, political instability, environmental changes, social networks, and personal aspirations. Immigration involves the movement of people into a new country to settle, while emigration refers to the movement of people out of a country to live elsewhere. Migration patterns can have significant demographic, economic, social, and cultural impacts on both the areas of origin and the areas of destination, influencing population size and composition, labor markets, cultural diversity, and social integration. Sociologists study migration to understand its causes and consequences, the experiences of migrants, and the policies and social responses to migration flows.

Semantical explanation of population_ID000001: 
In the context of social research, the population refers to the entire group of people who are the focus of a study or survey and about whom the researcher wants to draw conclusions. The population can be defined by specific characteristics, such as age, gender, ethnicity, geographic location, or membership in a particular group. Due to practical constraints, researchers often study a smaller subset of the population, known as a sample, and then generalise their findings from the sample back to the larger population, provided that the sample is representative of the population as a whole. Defining the target population clearly is a crucial step in the research design process.

Causal relation: {Migration, Population} → influencesHistorically → {Urbanism, Cultural_Diversity}

Semantical explanation of urbanism_ID000001: 
Urbanism is a term used by sociologist Louis Wirth to denote the distinctive characteristics of social life that emerge in urban settings, particularly in large, densely populated cities, such as a greater degree of impersonality, anonymity, social heterogeneity, and a more complex division of labor compared to rural areas. Wirth argued that the size, density, and heterogeneity of urban populations shape the nature of social interactions and the social psychology of city dwellers, often leading to more formal and instrumental relationships, increased social tolerance for diversity, and a greater sense of individual freedom alongside potential feelings of social isolation or alienation. The study of urbanism explores how these unique social patterns and experiences in cities differ from those in more rural or traditional communities.

Causal relation: {Migration, Population} → influencesHistorically → {Urbanism, Cultural_Diversity}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Diversity_ID000003: 
Cultural Diversity refers to the variety and richness of different cultures, subcultures, and ethnic groups that coexist within a given society or across the globe. It encompasses the wide array of unique values, norms, beliefs, languages, customs, traditions, social practices, and forms of expression that distinguish these groups from one another. This diversity contributes to the multifaceted nature of human society, reflecting the myriad ways in which people organise their lives, understand the world, and express themselves. Cultural diversity is often celebrated for enriching society by fostering innovation, creativity, a broader range of perspectives, and a more vibrant cultural landscape, thereby enhancing cultural vitality and mutual understanding. However, it can also present challenges related to social cohesion, intergroup relations, and potential conflicts arising from differing values, competing interests, or the historical legacies of power imbalances and discrimination. Sociologists study cultural diversity to understand how different groups maintain their distinct identities while interacting within a larger social framework, and how societies manage diversity to promote inclusion, equality, and social harmony, moving beyond assimilationist models towards valuing cultural pluralism and multiculturalism, and addressing issues like prejudice and segregation.

Causal relation: {Nation_State, Nationalism} → socialises → {Politics, Identity}

Semantical explanation of nation_State_ID000002: 
A nation state is a political apparatus that exercises sovereignty and authority over a specific territory, with a population of citizens who typically share a strong sense of national identity, often reinforced by common cultural characteristics such as language, religion, and a perceived shared history, and whose authority is backed up by military force and a nationalistic, sovereign creed. The concept of a nation state combines the political entity of the state with the cultural and social entity of the nation, where the state is seen as representing and protecting the interests and identity of the nation within its defined borders. The rise of the nation state is a key feature of modern political history, particularly in Europe, and it continues to be the dominant form of political organisation globally, although the relationship between nation and state can be complex and contested, especially in diverse or multinational states.

Semantical explanation of nationalism_ID000001: 
Nationalism is a complex set of beliefs, political ideas, and social movements that express a strong sense of identification with a given national community and pursue the interests, unity, and sovereignty of that community, often prioritizing national interests above all other considerations. Nationalism typically involves a belief in the unique character and destiny of one's nation, a sense of pride and loyalty to the nation, and a desire to promote its culture, interests, and well-being. It can be a powerful force in shaping political landscapes, driving movements for national independence, unification, or expansion, and influencing international relations. While nationalism can foster social cohesion and a sense of collective identity, it can also lead to exclusionary attitudes towards other nations and minority groups, as well as to conflict and rivalry between nations.

Politics, in Harold D.

It involves the exercise of power and influence to shape policies, make collective decisions, and resolve conflicts over competing interests and values. Politics operates at various levels, from interpersonal relationships and small groups to national and international arenas, and is a central aspect of social organisation and governance.

Causal relation: {Nation_State, Nationalism} → socialises → {Politics, Identity}

Semantical explanation of identity_ID000005: 
Identity refers to the distinctive characteristics of a person's character or the character of a group which relate to who they are and what is meaningful to them, providing a sense of self and belonging. Some of the main sources of identity include gender, encompassing social expectations of masculinity and femininity; sexual orientation, referring to patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction; nationality or ethnicity, based on shared cultural heritage, origin, and often language or religion; and social class, reflecting one's position in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Identity is not fixed but is fluid and can evolve over an individual's life course through interactions with others and within different social contexts. It shapes how individuals perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others, influencing their social interactions, opportunities, and experiences within society.

Semantical explanation of organisation_ID000001: 
An organisation in sociology refers to a large group of individuals who are structured and coordinated to achieve specific goals or purposes, involving a definite set of authority relations, rules, and procedures that govern their activities. Organisations can range from formal entities like corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions to more informal groups with shared objectives. They are characterised by a division of labor, a hierarchy of authority, and established patterns of communication and interaction among their members. Sociologists study organisations to understand their structure, culture, dynamics, and their role in shaping social life and achieving collective goals.

Causal relation: {Organisation} → coordinates → {Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of collective_Behaviour_ID000003: 
Collective behaviour encompasses activities of people and social groups that typically emerge spontaneously (such as crowds, riots, and so on) rather than arising from established processes of socialisation leading to conformity to social rules and norms. These behaviours often occur in response to a shared situation or stimulus and can involve large numbers of people acting in relatively unstructured ways. Examples of collective behaviour include panics, fads, rumors, social movements, and disasters. Sociologists study collective behaviour to understand the dynamics of group actions that are not governed by typical social structures or institutions. Factors such as anonymity, suggestibility, and the rapid spread of information can play a significant role in shaping collective behaviour.

Causal relation: {Coalition, Interest_Group} → collaboratesWith → {Resource_Mobilisation, Quality_Circle}

Semantical explanation of coalition_ID000001: 
A coalition is a temporary or permanent alliance geared toward a common goal, often formed by individuals or groups who may have different interests or goals in other areas but come together to achieve a specific shared objective. Coalitions can be found in various social contexts, including politics, business, and social movements. They are often formed to increase the collective power and influence of the participating members in order to achieve a goal that might be difficult or impossible to achieve individually. The stability and effectiveness of a coalition can depend on factors such as the clarity of the common goal, the commitment of the members, and the distribution of power within the alliance. Coalitions can be fluid and may dissolve once the shared goal is achieved or if internal conflicts arise.

Semantical explanation of interest_Group_ID000003: 
An interest group is a voluntary association of citizens who come together with the shared goal of attempting to influence public policy in their favour. These groups advocate for specific issues or the interests of their members by lobbying government officials, raising public awareness, and mobilizing support for their cause. Interest groups can represent a wide range of concerns, including economic interests (e.g., business associations, labor unions), social issues (e.g., environmental groups, civil rights organisations), and professional interests (e.g., medical associations, bar associations). They play a significant role in the political process by providing information to policymakers, contributing to political campaigns, and putting pressure on elected officials to support their agendas. The activities of interest groups are a key aspect of understanding how public policy is shaped and the various influences at play in democratic societies.

Causal relation: {Coalition, Interest_Group} → collaboratesWith → {Resource_Mobilisation, Quality_Circle}

Semantical explanation of resource_Mobilisation_ID000001: 
Resource mobilisation theory (RMT) is a major theoretical perspective in the study of social movements that emphasises the crucial role of resourcesâ€”such as money, political influence, access to the media, personnel (volunteers and staff), and communication networksâ€”in the emergence, growth, and success of social movements. RMT argues that grievances or social discontent are widespread and are not sufficient on their own to explain the development of social movements; rather, it is the ability of aggrieved groups to mobilise and effectively utilise various types of resources that determines whether a social movement will form and achieve its goals. This theory focuses on the strategic actions of social movement organisations in acquiring, organizing, and deploying resources to challenge existing power structures and bring about social change.

Semantical explanation of quality_Circle_ID000001: 
A quality circle is a type of industrialised group production or work team, often found in manufacturing or service industries, where workers who are involved in a particular area of work come together regularly to use their collective expertise and knowledge to actively participate in problem-solving, decision-making, and continuous improvement processes related to the quality of products, services, or work processes. These circles typically involve a small group of employees who meet voluntarily and are trained in problem-solving techniques to identify, analyse, and propose solutions to work-related issues, aiming to enhance efficiency, productivity, and the quality of outcomes by leveraging the insights and experiences of those directly involved in the work.

Semantical explanation of bureaucracy_ID000005: 
Bureaucracy is an organisation of a hierarchical sort, which takes the form of a pyramid of authority, with clear lines of command and responsibility. The term 'bureaucracy' was popularised by Max Weber, who considered it the most efficient type of large-scale human organisation in modern society. According to Weber, bureaucracy is characterised by a division of labor, a clearly defined hierarchy, formal rules and regulations, impersonality, and a focus on technical competence. As organisations grow in size and complexity, Weber argued, they inevitably tend to become more and more bureaucratised to manage their operations effectively.

Causal relation: {Organisation, Bureaucracy} → coordinates → {Structuration, Rationalisation}

Semantical explanation of structuration_ID000001: 
Structuration is a sociological theory, most prominently associated with the work of Anthony Giddens, that attempts to bridge the divide between agency (the actions of individuals) and social structure (the broader social forces and institutions that shape those actions). It posits that social structure and human agency are not separate or opposing forces but are mutually dependent and interactive in a two-way process. Individuals shape their social world through their everyday actions and practices, but these actions are also enabled and constrained by existing social structures, which in turn are reproduced and sometimes transformed through those very actions. Structuration emphasises the dynamic and recursive relationship between individual agency and social structure, highlighting how they continuously influence and reshape each other over time.

Causal relation: {Organisation, Bureaucracy} → coordinates → {Structuration, Rationalisation}

Semantical explanation of rationalisation_ID000004: 
Rationalisation is a concept extensively used by Max Weber to refer to the multifaceted process by which modes of precise calculation, efficiency-oriented organisation, and action based on abstract rules, laws, and procedures increasingly come to dominate the social world, replacing more traditional, emotional, or value-driven forms of social organisation and behaviour. This process is a central theme in Weber's analysis of modernity and is closely linked to the rise of bureaucracy, capitalism, and science. Rationalisation involves a shift towards systematic thinking, the application of reason and logic to social life, and an emphasis on predictability and control through formal structures and procedures. While it has led to advancements in technology, efficiency, and administration, Weber also cautioned about the potential negative consequences of rationalisation, such as the disenchantment of the world and the dominance of impersonal bureaucratic structures.

Semantical explanation of bureaucracy_ID000006: 
Bureaucracy is an organisation of a hierarchical sort, which takes the form of a pyramid of authority, with clear lines of command and responsibility. The term 'bureaucracy' was popularised by Max Weber, who considered it the most efficient type of large-scale human organisation in modern society. According to Weber, bureaucracy is characterised by a division of labor, a clearly defined hierarchy, formal rules and regulations, impersonality, and a focus on technical competence. As organisations grow in size and complexity, Weber argued, they inevitably tend to become more and more bureaucratised to manage their operations effectively.

Causal relation: {Bureaucracy, Formal_Organisation} → manages → {Organisation, Invention}

Semantical explanation of formal_Organisation_ID000004: 
A formal organisation is a special-purpose group designed and structured for maximum efficiency in achieving specific goals or objectives. These organisations are characterised by a hierarchical structure of authority, a clear division of labor based on specialised roles and responsibilities, formal rules and procedures governing operations, and impersonal relationships among members. Examples of formal organisations include corporations, government agencies, universities, and hospitals. Max Weber's concept of bureaucracy is a classic example of a formal organisation designed for rational and efficient goal attainment. The formal structure of these organisations aims to ensure coordination, accountability, and predictability in their operations, although it can sometimes lead to rigidity and a lack of flexibility.

Semantical explanation of organisation_ID000003: 
An organisation in sociology refers to a large group of individuals who are structured and coordinated to achieve specific goals or purposes, involving a definite set of authority relations, rules, and procedures that govern their activities. Organisations can range from formal entities like corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions to more informal groups with shared objectives. They are characterised by a division of labor, a hierarchy of authority, and established patterns of communication and interaction among their members. Sociologists study organisations to understand their structure, culture, dynamics, and their role in shaping social life and achieving collective goals.

Semantical explanation of invention_ID000001: 
Invention is the process of combining existing cultural items, ideas, or technologies into a new form that did not previously exist. It involves creativity and innovation to produce something novel, whether it is a tangible object, a new method, or a new concept. Inventions can range from simple tools to complex technological systems and can have significant impacts on society and culture, leading to social change and the development of new ways of life. Invention is one of the primary drivers of cultural innovation, alongside discovery, which involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown. The spread and adoption of inventions within a culture or across societies is a process known as diffusion.

Semantical explanation of participant_Observation_ID000002: 
Participant observation is a key method of research widely used in sociology and anthropology, particularly in ethnographic studies, in which the researcher takes part in the activities, routines, and daily life of a group or community being studied over an extended period of time, while also systematically observing their behaviour and interactions in their natural setting. The goal of participant observation is to gain an in-depth understanding of the group's culture, perspectives, and social world from an insider's point of view, by immersing oneself in their environment and experiencing life as they do. This method allows researchers to gather rich, qualitative data about social processes, meanings, and practices that may not be accessible through other research techniques like surveys or interviews alone.

Causal relation: {Participant_Observation, Ethnography} → observes → {Observation, Qualitative_Research}

Semantical explanation of ethnography_ID000002: 
Ethnography is a qualitative research method that involves the study of an entire social setting or cultural group through extended systematic observation and immersion in the field. Ethnographers aim to gain an in-depth understanding of the culture, behaviours, and social dynamics of the group being studied from the perspective of its members. This often involves the researcher spending a significant amount of time living among the people they are studying, participating in their daily activities, conducting interviews, and analysing cultural artifacts and symbols. The goal of ethnography is to provide a rich and detailed description of the social world of the group under study, capturing the nuances and complexities of their culture and social life. Ethnographic research is often used in anthropology and sociology to explore diverse cultural practices, social structures, and the meanings that people create and share in their everyday interactions.

Causal relation: {Participant_Observation, Ethnography} → observes → {Observation, Qualitative_Research}

Semantical explanation of observation_ID000001: 
Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.

Causal relation: {Participant_Observation, Ethnography} → observes → {Observation, Qualitative_Research}

Semantical explanation of qualitative_Research_ID000002: 
Qualitative research is a research approach that primarily relies on data that is not numerical and often involves studying social phenomena in their natural settings or "in the field" rather than in controlled laboratory environments. This type of research seeks to understand the qualities, characteristics, and meanings of social phenomena through methods such as observation, interviews, and the analysis of texts or artifacts. The focus is often on exploring the depth and complexity of experiences, perspectives, and social processes, rather than on quantifying them through statistical data. Qualitative research aims to provide rich, descriptive insights into the social world and the ways in which people interpret and make sense of their experiences.

Semantical explanation of patriarchy_ID000003: 
Patriarchy is a form of social organisation in which men hold the primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property, and in the domain of the family where fathers or father figures hold authority over women and children. This system often involves the oppression and exploitation of women, who typically have less access to resources and decision-making processes. Patriarchal structures are prevalent in many societies throughout history and continue to shape gender relations and social inequalities in various ways, influencing laws, customs, and cultural norms that often favour men and limit the opportunities and autonomy of women.

Causal relation: {Patriarchy, Gender_Order} → subordinatedTo → {Authority, Gender_Roles}

Semantical explanation of gender_Order_ID000001: 
The gender order is a term associated with the writings of sociologist R. W. Connell that represents the overall patterns of power relations between masculinities and femininities that are widespread throughout society, shaping social institutions, interactions, and individual experiences. It encompasses the dominant cultural beliefs and practices that construct and maintain gender hierarchies, often privileging certain forms of masculinity while subordinating femininities and marginalised masculinities. The gender order is not static but is constantly being negotiated and contested through social interactions and power struggles. It influences everything from the division of labor in the household and the workplace to cultural representations of gender in media and the ways in which individuals perform their gender identities. Understanding the gender order is crucial for analysing and challenging systemic gender inequalities in society.

Causal relation: {Patriarchy, Gender_Order} → subordinatedTo → {Authority, Gender_Roles}

Semantical explanation of authority_ID000003: 
Authority is power that has been institutionalised and is recognised by the people over whom it is exercised. It is a form of legitimate power, meaning that those subject to it accept its rightfulness. Sociologist Max Weber identified three main types of authority: traditional authority, charismatic authority, and rational-legal authority. Traditional authority is based on long-established customs and traditions, often associated with hereditary leadership. Charismatic authority stems from the exceptional personal qualities or appeal of a leader, inspiring devotion and obedience. Rational-legal authority is based on formal rules, laws, and procedures, typically associated with bureaucratic systems and elected officials. The recognition and acceptance of authority are crucial for maintaining social order and stability within a society. When power is perceived as legitimate authority, it is more likely to be obeyed and less likely to be challenged.

Causal relation: {Patriarchy, Gender_Order} → subordinatedTo → {Authority, Gender_Roles}

Semantical explanation of gender_Roles_ID000001: 
Gender roles are the social roles, behaviours, attitudes, and expectations that are considered appropriate, acceptable, or desirable for people based on their perceived sex or gender within a particular culture or society. These roles are often labeled as masculine or feminine and are learned through the process of socialisation from a young age, influenced by family, peers, education, media, and other social institutions. Gender roles can vary significantly across different cultures and can change over time within the same society. While they provide a framework for social interaction and can contribute to a sense of identity, they can also be restrictive and contribute to gender stereotypes and inequalities by limiting individuals' opportunities and expressions based on societal expectations of their gender. The study of gender roles in sociology examines how they are constructed, maintained, and challenged, and their impact on individuals and social structures.

Causal relation: {Patriarchy, Gender_Roles} → stratifies → {Gender_Inequality, Gender_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of patriarchy_ID000004: 
Patriarchy is a form of social organisation in which men hold the primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property, and in the domain of the family where fathers or father figures hold authority over women and children. This system often involves the oppression and exploitation of women, who typically have less access to resources and decision-making processes. Patriarchal structures are prevalent in many societies throughout history and continue to shape gender relations and social inequalities in various ways, influencing laws, customs, and cultural norms that often favour men and limit the opportunities and autonomy of women.

Causal relation: {Patriarchy, Gender_Roles} → stratifies → {Gender_Inequality, Gender_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of gender_Roles_ID000002: 
Gender roles are the social roles, behaviours, attitudes, and expectations that are considered appropriate, acceptable, or desirable for people based on their perceived sex or gender within a particular culture or society. These roles are often labeled as masculine or feminine and are learned through the process of socialisation from a young age, influenced by family, peers, education, media, and other social institutions. Gender roles can vary significantly across different cultures and can change over time within the same society. While they provide a framework for social interaction and can contribute to a sense of identity, they can also be restrictive and contribute to gender stereotypes and inequalities by limiting individuals' opportunities and expressions based on societal expectations of their gender. The study of gender roles in sociology examines how they are constructed, maintained, and challenged, and their impact on individuals and social structures.

Causal relation: {Patriarchy, Gender_Roles} → stratifies → {Gender_Inequality, Gender_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of gender_Inequality_ID000005: 
Gender inequality refers to the differences in the status, power, prestige, opportunities, and resources that women and men have in groups, collectivities, and societies. This inequality is often manifested in various forms, including disparities in economic opportunities and earnings (such as the gender pay gap), political representation and influence, access to education and healthcare, and social and cultural norms that privilege one gender over the other, typically men. Gender inequality is a pervasive issue across many societies, although its specific forms and extent can vary significantly across cultures and historical periods. Feminist theories in sociology aim to understand the social, cultural, and historical roots of gender inequality and to advocate for social change that promotes gender equality and justice.

Causal relation: {Patriarchy, Gender_Roles} → stratifies → {Gender_Inequality, Gender_Stratification}

Semantical explanation of gender_Stratification_ID000004: 
Gender stratification refers to a society's unequal distribution of wealth, power, and privilege between the two sexes, with one gender (typically men) holding a disproportionate share of these resources and social advantages. This hierarchical arrangement is evident in various aspects of social life, including the economic sphere (e.g., the gender pay gap, occupational segregation), the political arena (e.g., underrepresentation of women in leadership positions), and social institutions (e.g., differential treatment in education and healthcare). Gender stratification is not simply a matter of individual differences but is embedded in the social structure and perpetuated by cultural norms, beliefs, and practices that often favour men and disadvantage women. Feminist theories in sociology critically examine the causes and consequences of gender stratification and advocate for social equality between the sexes.

Semantical explanation of peer_Group_ID000002: 
A peer group is a social group whose members share common characteristics such as similar interests, social position, age, and often a sense of shared identity and belonging. Peer groups play a significant role in the socialisation process, particularly during adolescence, influencing individuals' attitudes, values, behaviours, and self-concept. They provide a context for learning social skills, developing relationships, and establishing norms and expectations that may differ from those of the family or broader society. Peer influence can be strong, shaping choices related to fashion, music, activities, and even academic performance. Peer groups can provide social support and a sense of community, but they can also exert pressure to conform to group norms, sometimes in ways that may be positive or negative for the individual.

Causal relation: {Peer_Group, Social_Network} → socialises → {Identity, Socialisation}

Semantical explanation of social_Network_ID000001: 
A social network refers to a series of interconnected social relationships that links an individual directly to other people and, through them, indirectly to an even wider circle of individuals, forming a complex web of social connections. These networks can be based on various types of relationships, including friendship, kinship, work affiliations, shared interests, or online interactions, and they facilitate the flow of information, resources, social support, and influence among the individuals within them. The structure and characteristics of an individual's social network, such as its size, density, and the strength of its ties, can have significant implications for their opportunities, well-being, and social capital, which is the collective benefit derived from social connections and relationships.

Causal relation: {Peer_Group, Social_Network} → socialises → {Identity, Socialisation}

Semantical explanation of identity_ID000006: 
Identity refers to the distinctive characteristics of a person's character or the character of a group which relate to who they are and what is meaningful to them, providing a sense of self and belonging. Some of the main sources of identity include gender, encompassing social expectations of masculinity and femininity; sexual orientation, referring to patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction; nationality or ethnicity, based on shared cultural heritage, origin, and often language or religion; and social class, reflecting one's position in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Identity is not fixed but is fluid and can evolve over an individual's life course through interactions with others and within different social contexts. It shapes how individuals perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others, influencing their social interactions, opportunities, and experiences within society.

Causal relation: {Peer_Group, Social_Network} → socialises → {Identity, Socialisation}

Semantical explanation of socialisation_ID000003: 
Socialisation refers to the lifelong social processes through which individuals develop an awareness of social norms, values, beliefs, and behaviours of their culture and society, and achieve a distinct sense of self and identity. This process begins in early childhood with primary socialisation within the family, where children learn basic language, social skills, and cultural norms from parents and close relatives. As individuals grow, they continue to be socialised through secondary agents such as schools, peer groups, the media, religion, and the workplace, learning the more specific roles, expectations, and behaviours associated with different social contexts and stages of life. Socialisation is crucial for individuals to become integrated members of their society and for the transmission of culture across generations.

Causal relation: {Government, Bureaucracy} → governs → {Social_Control, Law}

Semantical explanation of government_ID000002: 
Government refers to the regular enactment of policies, decisions, and matters of state by officials within a political apparatus, representing the formal organisation that has the authority to make and enforce laws and regulations within a specific territory or society. It encompasses the various institutions and processes through which a state exercises its power and authority, including legislative bodies that create laws, executive branches that implement and enforce them, and judicial systems that interpret laws and resolve disputes. Governments play a crucial role in maintaining social order, providing public services, regulating the economy, and representing the interests of the state in its interactions with other nations. The form and structure of government can vary widely, ranging from democracies to authoritarian regimes, each with different mechanisms for the selection of officials and the exercise of power. Political sociology examines the role of government in society, its relationship with citizens and other social institutions, and the factors that influence its policies and actions.

Causal relation: {Government, Bureaucracy} → governs → {Social_Control, Law}

Semantical explanation of bureaucracy_ID000007: 
Bureaucracy is an organisation of a hierarchical sort, which takes the form of a pyramid of authority, with clear lines of command and responsibility. The term 'bureaucracy' was popularised by Max Weber, who considered it the most efficient type of large-scale human organisation in modern society. According to Weber, bureaucracy is characterised by a division of labor, a clearly defined hierarchy, formal rules and regulations, impersonality, and a focus on technical competence. As organisations grow in size and complexity, Weber argued, they inevitably tend to become more and more bureaucratised to manage their operations effectively.

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000006: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Semantical explanation of law_ID000006: 
Law refers to governmental social control, representing a formal system of rules and regulations enacted and enforced by political authorities to govern behaviour and maintain social order within a society. Laws are typically written down and specify both the behaviours that are prohibited or required and the sanctions or penalties that will be applied when violations occur. The legal system includes various institutions, such as legislatures that create laws, law enforcement agencies that enforce them, and courts that interpret laws and adjudicate disputes. Law plays a crucial role in establishing norms, resolving conflicts, protecting rights, and providing a framework for social interaction in complex societies. The legitimacy and effectiveness of law depend on its acceptance by the people it governs and its consistent and fair application.

Semantical explanation of interest_Group_ID000004: 
An interest group is a voluntary association of citizens who come together with the shared goal of attempting to influence public policy in their favour. These groups advocate for specific issues or the interests of their members by lobbying government officials, raising public awareness, and mobilizing support for their cause. Interest groups can represent a wide range of concerns, including economic interests (e.g., business associations, labor unions), social issues (e.g., environmental groups, civil rights organisations), and professional interests (e.g., medical associations, bar associations). They play a significant role in the political process by providing information to policymakers, contributing to political campaigns, and putting pressure on elected officials to support their agendas. The activities of interest groups are a key aspect of understanding how public policy is shaped and the various influences at play in democratic societies.

Semantical explanation of democracy_ID000005: 
Democracy is a political system in which power is exercised by the people as a whole, either directly or through elected representatives. Key principles of democracy typically include free and fair elections, the rule of law, protection of individual rights and freedoms (such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press), and the accountability of government to the people. Democratic systems can take various forms, such as parliamentary democracies, presidential democracies, and direct democracies, each with its own specific structures and processes for decision-making and governance. The concept of democracy is often associated with values such as equality, participation, and the consent of the governed. The spread and consolidation of democracy have been major themes in political sociology, with researchers studying the factors that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of democratic institutions around the world.

Semantical explanation of politics_ID000007: 
Politics, in Harold D. Lasswell's classic definition, is fundamentally about "who gets what, when, and how," highlighting the struggle for power and resources within a society and the processes through which decisions are made about their distribution and allocation. It involves the exercise of power and influence to shape policies, make collective decisions, and resolve conflicts over competing interests and values. Politics operates at various levels, from interpersonal relationships and small groups to national and international arenas, and is a central aspect of social organisation and governance.

Participatory democracy is a system of democracy that emphasises the broad participation of all members of a group or community in the collective taking of major decisions that affect their lives, rather than relying solely on elected representatives to make decisions on their behalf. This form of democracy seeks to maximise citizen involvement in political and social decision-making processes, often through direct participation in forums, assemblies, or other mechanisms that allow for collective deliberation and action. The aim of participatory democracy is to empower individuals and communities to have a greater say in shaping their own futures and to promote a more inclusive and responsive form of governance.

Causal relation: {Political_Action_Committee_(PAC), Interest_Group} → mobilises → {Resource_Mobilisation, Politics}

Semantical explanation of political_Action_Committee_(PAC)_ID000003: 
A political action committee (PAC) is a political committee that is typically established by an interest groupâ€”such as a national bank, corporation, trade association, cooperative, or membership associationâ€”for the specific purpose of soliciting and distributing financial contributions to candidates running for political office or to political parties. PACs are a significant part of the campaign finance system in many democracies, allowing organised groups to pool resources and support candidates who align with their interests and policy objectives. The regulations governing PACs, including the amount of money they can raise and contribute, vary depending on the jurisdiction.

Causal relation: {Political_Action_Committee_(PAC), Interest_Group} → mobilises → {Resource_Mobilisation, Politics}

Semantical explanation of interest_Group_ID000005: 
An interest group is a voluntary association of citizens who come together with the shared goal of attempting to influence public policy in their favour. These groups advocate for specific issues or the interests of their members by lobbying government officials, raising public awareness, and mobilizing support for their cause. Interest groups can represent a wide range of concerns, including economic interests (e.g., business associations, labor unions), social issues (e.g., environmental groups, civil rights organisations), and professional interests (e.g., medical associations, bar associations). They play a significant role in the political process by providing information to policymakers, contributing to political campaigns, and putting pressure on elected officials to support their agendas. The activities of interest groups are a key aspect of understanding how public policy is shaped and the various influences at play in democratic societies.

Causal relation: {Political_Action_Committee_(PAC), Interest_Group} → mobilises → {Resource_Mobilisation, Politics}

Semantical explanation of resource_Mobilisation_ID000002: 
Resource mobilisation theory (RMT) is a major theoretical perspective in the study of social movements that emphasises the crucial role of resourcesâ€”such as money, political influence, access to the media, personnel (volunteers and staff), and communication networksâ€”in the emergence, growth, and success of social movements. RMT argues that grievances or social discontent are widespread and are not sufficient on their own to explain the development of social movements; rather, it is the ability of aggrieved groups to mobilise and effectively utilise various types of resources that determines whether a social movement will form and achieve its goals. This theory focuses on the strategic actions of social movement organisations in acquiring, organizing, and deploying resources to challenge existing power structures and bring about social change.

Semantical explanation of politics_ID000008: 
Politics, in Harold D. Lasswell's classic definition, is fundamentally about "who gets what, when, and how," highlighting the struggle for power and resources within a society and the processes through which decisions are made about their distribution and allocation. It involves the exercise of power and influence to shape policies, make collective decisions, and resolve conflicts over competing interests and values. Politics operates at various levels, from interpersonal relationships and small groups to national and international arenas, and is a central aspect of social organisation and governance.

Causal relation: {Political_Systems_And_Governance_Forms} → bureaucratises → {Formal_Organisation}

Semantical explanation of political_Systems_And_Governance_Forms_ID000001: 
Political_Systems_And_Governance_Forms encompasses the fundamental organisational structures and institutional arrangements through which political authority is exercised, legitimated, and maintained within societies. This category represents the core architectural frameworks that define how power is distributed, exercised, and constrained in political communities. These systems establish the basic rules and procedures for collective decision-making, the selection of leaders, and the relationship between governing institutions and citizens. The category includes both democratic forms that emphasise popular participation and consent, as well as traditional forms like monarchies that derive legitimacy from historical precedent and hereditary succession. Each system embodies different principles regarding the source of political authority, the mechanisms of accountability, and the balance between individual rights and collective governance. These governance forms represent realizable entities that can be instantiated in different societies and historical contexts, each carrying specific potentials for political participation, representation, and the exercise of state power. The category captures the diversity of ways human societies have organised political authority while recognizing common patterns in institutional design and legitimation.

Causal relation: {Political_Systems_And_Governance_Forms} → bureaucratises → {Formal_Organisation}

Semantical explanation of formal_Organisation_ID000005: 
A formal organisation is a special-purpose group designed and structured for maximum efficiency in achieving specific goals or objectives. These organisations are characterised by a hierarchical structure of authority, a clear division of labor based on specialised roles and responsibilities, formal rules and procedures governing operations, and impersonal relationships among members. Examples of formal organisations include corporations, government agencies, universities, and hospitals. Max Weber's concept of bureaucracy is a classic example of a formal organisation designed for rational and efficient goal attainment. The formal structure of these organisations aims to ensure coordination, accountability, and predictability in their operations, although it can sometimes lead to rigidity and a lack of flexibility.

Causal relation: {Migration, Immigration} → migrates → {Diaspora, Push_And_Pull_Factors}

Semantical explanation of migration_ID000004: 
Migration refers to the movement of people into and out of a particular territory, which can occur within a country (internal migration) or across national borders (international migration). This movement can be temporary or permanent and can be driven by a variety of factors, including economic opportunities, political instability, environmental changes, social networks, and personal aspirations. Immigration involves the movement of people into a new country to settle, while emigration refers to the movement of people out of a country to live elsewhere. Migration patterns can have significant demographic, economic, social, and cultural impacts on both the areas of origin and the areas of destination, influencing population size and composition, labor markets, cultural diversity, and social integration. Sociologists study migration to understand its causes and consequences, the experiences of migrants, and the policies and social responses to migration flows.

Semantical explanation of immigration_ID000002: 
Immigration is the movement of people into one country from another with the intention of settling permanently or for an extended period. This cross-border migration can occur for a variety of reasons, including seeking better economic opportunities, escaping poverty, conflict, or persecution, joining family members, or pursuing education and personal development. Immigration has significant social, economic, and cultural impacts on both the sending and receiving countries, contributing to population growth and diversity, influencing labor markets, and shaping cultural landscapes. The experiences of immigrants can vary widely depending on factors such as their reasons for migrating, their skills and resources, the policies and attitudes of the host country, and the presence of established immigrant communities.

Causal relation: {Migration, Immigration} → migrates → {Diaspora, Push_And_Pull_Factors}

Semantical explanation of diaspora_ID000001: 
Diaspora refers to the dispersal of an ethnic population from an original homeland into foreign areas, often in a forced manner or under traumatic circumstances such as war, famine, or persecution. The term can also refer to the communities formed by these dispersed people in their new locations, who often maintain a sense of connection to their homeland and a shared cultural identity. Examples of diasporas include the Jewish diaspora, the African diaspora resulting from the slave trade, and the Armenian diaspora following the genocide. Diasporic communities often play a significant role in transnational networks, maintaining cultural traditions, and sometimes engaging in political or economic activities related to their homeland. The study of diasporas examines issues of identity, belonging, cultural adaptation, and the complex relationships between diasporic communities and both their homeland and their adopted countries.

Causal relation: {Migration, Immigration} → migrates → {Diaspora, Push_And_Pull_Factors}

Semantical explanation of push_And_Pull_Factors_ID000001: 
In the early study of global migration, push and pull factors were identified as the internal and external forces believed to significantly influence patterns of migration. 'Push factors' refer to the dynamics and conditions within the country of origin that compel people to leave, such as high rates of unemployment, economic hardship, war or conflict, famine or natural disasters, political persecution, or lack of opportunities. 'Pull factors' describe the features and characteristics of destination countries that attract migrants, such as a buoyant labor market with available jobs, higher wages, lower population density, a higher standard of living, better educational or healthcare opportunities, political stability, or the presence of established communities of migrants from the same origin country. While this model provides a basic framework for understanding migration decisions, contemporary migration studies recognise that the process is often more complex and influenced by a wider range of interconnected factors, including social networks, government policies, and individual agency.

Causal relation: {Post-Fordism, Flexible_Production} → influencesHistorically → {Job_Insecurity, Outsourcing}

Semantical explanation of post-Fordism_ID000001: 
Post-Fordism is a general term used to describe the transition from mass industrial production, which was characterised by Fordist methods of standardised production, assembly lines, and economies of scale, to more flexible and diversified forms of production that favour innovation, cater to niche markets, and are aimed at meeting increasingly differentiated market demands for customised and higher-quality products. This shift, which began in the late 20th century, is associated with advancements in technology, such as automation and computerisation, as well as changes in consumer preferences and global economic competition. Post-Fordist production systems often involve greater flexibility in production processes, the use of advanced technologies to allow for product variation, a more skilled and adaptable workforce, and a focus on quality and innovation rather than just mass quantity.

Causal relation: {Post-Fordism, Flexible_Production} → influencesHistorically → {Job_Insecurity, Outsourcing}

Semantical explanation of flexible_Production_ID000001: 
Flexible production is a process in which computers and advanced technologies are used to design and produce customised products for a mass market, allowing for greater variety and responsiveness to consumer demand. This contrasts with traditional mass production systems like Fordism, which focused on producing large quantities of standardised goods. Flexible production systems often involve computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and robotics, enabling manufacturers to quickly adapt production lines to create different versions of a product or even entirely new products with relatively low switching costs. This approach allows for greater product differentiation and the ability to cater to niche markets, enhancing competitiveness in a globalised economy. Flexible production requires a skilled and adaptable workforce capable of working with advanced technologies.

Semantical explanation of job_Insecurity_ID000001: 
Job insecurity refers to a sense of apprehension, worry, or anxiety experienced by employees about both the stability of their current work position and their future role within the workplace or the broader labor market. This feeling can arise from various factors, such as economic downturns, company restructuring, technological changes leading to automation, globalisation and outsourcing of jobs, or changes in employment contracts and labor laws that reduce job security. High levels of job insecurity can have negative consequences for employees' mental and physical health, job satisfaction, productivity, and overall well-being, as well as impacting their families and communities. It can also affect organisational outcomes, leading to decreased employee loyalty and motivation.

Semantical explanation of outsourcing_ID000002: 
Outsourcing is the business practice of contracting out a company's work tasks, functions, or processes to external third-party providers or service providers, which were previously carried out internally by the company's own employees. Companies may choose to outsource for various reasons, such as to reduce costs, improve efficiency, access specialised skills or technologies, or focus on their core business activities. Outsourcing can involve a wide range of functions, including manufacturing, information technology services, customer support, human resources, and accounting. While it can offer benefits to companies, outsourcing can also have implications for the company's employees, potentially leading to job losses or changes in working conditions, and can also raise ethical considerations related to labor practices and quality control in the outsourced operations.

Causal relation: {Poverty, Underdevelopment} → causallyInfluencedBy → {Crime, Health}

Semantical explanation of poverty_ID000002: 
Poverty refers to a state of deprivation where individuals or families lack the sufficient financial resources or material possessions to meet their basic needs or maintain a living standard considered customary in their society. This broad category encompasses various forms, most commonly distinguished as absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty, also known as subsistence poverty, defines a condition where individuals lack the minimal resources required for basic survival, such as food, shelter, warmth, and safety, often measured by a fixed income threshold. Relative poverty, conversely, defines deprivation in relation to the living standards and average income levels of the majority within a particular society, implying social exclusion and a reduced ability to participate fully in customary activities. The feminisation of poverty highlights the increasing proportion of women among the poor. Poverty is a complex social problem influenced by economic systems, social inequalities, access to resources, and various structural and individual factors, leading to significant social and health consequences.

Causal relation: {Poverty, Underdevelopment} → causallyInfluencedBy → {Crime, Health}

Semantical explanation of underdevelopment_ID000002: 
Underdevelopment is a concept used in social science, particularly in the context of global inequality and post-colonial studies, to describe the economic state of societies, primarily in the Global South, that were historically exploited and/or previously colonised by Western countries during the periods of colonialism. This perspective suggests that the current state of poverty and limited economic development in many of these societies is not simply a natural or inevitable condition but is, in part, a result of historical processes of exploitation and dependence imposed by powerful, wealthy states, which actively extracted resources, disrupted local economies, and established unequal trade relationships that continue to disadvantage these nations. Underdevelopment theory emphasises the historical and ongoing power dynamics between developed and developing countries, highlighting how the wealth and prosperity of some nations may have been built upon the exploitation and impoverishment of others, perpetuating a cycle of dependence and hindering genuine economic development in the formerly colonised regions.

Causal relation: {Poverty, Underdevelopment} → causallyInfluencedBy → {Crime, Health}

Semantical explanation of crime_ID000005: 
Crime is a violation of criminal law for which formal penalties are applied by some governmental authority. What constitutes a crime is defined by legal statutes at the local, state, or federal level, and these definitions can vary across jurisdictions and change over time. Crimes are typically classified based on their severity, ranging from minor offenses (misdemeanors) to serious felonies. The criminal justice system, including law enforcement agencies, courts, and correctional institutions, is responsible for enforcing criminal laws, apprehending offenders, and administering penalties, which can include fines, probation, imprisonment, or, in some cases, capital punishment. Sociologists study crime from various perspectives, examining its social causes, patterns, and consequences, as well as the functioning of the criminal justice system and its impact on society.

Causal relation: {Poverty, Underdevelopment} → causallyInfluencedBy → {Crime, Health}

Semantical explanation of health_ID000001: 
As defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO), health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity. This definition emphasises a holistic view of health that goes beyond just the absence of illness to include the overall quality of an individual's physical, psychological, and social functioning and resources. It recognises that health is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, social, economic, and environmental factors. Achieving and maintaining health requires attention to all these dimensions and involves promoting well-being in all aspects of life. This broad definition underscores the sociological perspective on health, which examines how social factors shape health outcomes and inequalities within and between populations.

Semantical explanation of power_ID000004: 
Power, in its most fundamental sociological sense, is the ability of an individual or group to exercise their will over others, even in the face of resistance, and to bring about desired outcomes or to prevent undesired ones. Power can manifest in various forms, including political power, economic power, social power, and cultural power, and it can be based on different sources such as authority, force, influence, or control over resources. The study of power is central to sociology, as it underlies social inequalities, shapes social interactions, and drives social change. Sociologists analyse how power is distributed, how it is used and contested, and its impact on individuals, groups, and social structures.

Causal relation: {Power, Authority} → controls → {Government, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of authority_ID000004: 
Authority is power that has been institutionalised and is recognised by the people over whom it is exercised. It is a form of legitimate power, meaning that those subject to it accept its rightfulness. Sociologist Max Weber identified three main types of authority: traditional authority, charismatic authority, and rational-legal authority. Traditional authority is based on long-established customs and traditions, often associated with hereditary leadership. Charismatic authority stems from the exceptional personal qualities or appeal of a leader, inspiring devotion and obedience. Rational-legal authority is based on formal rules, laws, and procedures, typically associated with bureaucratic systems and elected officials. The recognition and acceptance of authority are crucial for maintaining social order and stability within a society. When power is perceived as legitimate authority, it is more likely to be obeyed and less likely to be challenged.

Causal relation: {Power, Authority} → controls → {Government, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of government_ID000003: 
Government refers to the regular enactment of policies, decisions, and matters of state by officials within a political apparatus, representing the formal organisation that has the authority to make and enforce laws and regulations within a specific territory or society. It encompasses the various institutions and processes through which a state exercises its power and authority, including legislative bodies that create laws, executive branches that implement and enforce them, and judicial systems that interpret laws and resolve disputes. Governments play a crucial role in maintaining social order, providing public services, regulating the economy, and representing the interests of the state in its interactions with other nations. The form and structure of government can vary widely, ranging from democracies to authoritarian regimes, each with different mechanisms for the selection of officials and the exercise of power. Political sociology examines the role of government in society, its relationship with citizens and other social institutions, and the factors that influence its policies and actions.

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000007: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Causal relation: {Power_Elite} → mobilises → {Social_Change}

Semantical explanation of power_Elite_ID000004: 
Power elite is a term popularised by sociologist C. Wright Mills to describe a relatively small, tightly knit group of individuals who occupy the top positions in the dominant institutions of American societyâ€”namely, the military, the industrial (corporate) sector, and the governmentâ€”and who collectively hold the most power and make key decisions that shape the fate of the United States. According to Mills, these elites share similar backgrounds, interests, and worldviews, and their decisions have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the population, often operating outside of traditional democratic processes and accountability. The theory of the power elite suggests that power in modern industrial societies is concentrated rather than widely dispersed.

Semantical explanation of social_Change_ID000009: 
Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Semantical explanation of primary_Group_ID000001: 
A primary group is a small social group characterised by intimate, face-to-face association and cooperation among its members, fostering close, personal, and often emotional relationships. These groups, such as family members, close friends, or a tightly knit group of peers, are typically characterised by a strong sense of belonging, mutual support, and shared activities and experiences. Interactions within primary groups are often informal, spontaneous, and deeply personal, playing a crucial role in the socialisation process, the development of self-identity, and the provision of emotional well-being for their members.

Causal relation: {Primary_Group, Small_Group} → communicatesWith → {Social_Interaction, Dyad}

Semantical explanation of small_Group_ID000001: 
A small group in sociology is typically defined as a group of individuals that is small enough in size for all members to interact simultaneously with one another, meaning they can engage in direct face-to-face communication, such as talking with one another or at least being personally acquainted. The size of a small group can vary, but it is usually considered to be a number where direct interaction and mutual awareness are feasible, often ranging from a dyad (two people) to a group of around 15-20 members. Small groups are characterised by closer relationships, more intimate interactions, and a greater sense of personal connection and mutual influence among members compared to larger, more formal groups. They play a crucial role in social life, providing a context for primary relationships, socialisation, and the development of social norms and identities.

Causal relation: {Primary_Group, Small_Group} → communicatesWith → {Social_Interaction, Dyad}

Semantical explanation of social_Interaction_ID000002: 
Social interaction is the fundamental process by which people act and react in relation to others, involving communication, mutual influence, and the creation of shared meanings and social bonds. It occurs at all levels of social life, from brief encounters between strangers to long-term relationships within families and close-knit groups, and in formal settings like workplaces and organisations as well as informal settings like social gatherings. Social interaction can take various forms, including verbal communication, nonverbal cues such as gestures and facial expressions, and the exchange of symbols and meanings. It is through social interaction that individuals develop their sense of self, learn social norms, establish relationships, and collectively construct social reality. The study of social interaction is a core focus of microsociology, aiming to understand the patterns and dynamics of everyday social life.

Causal relation: {Primary_Group, Small_Group} → communicatesWith → {Social_Interaction, Dyad}

Semantical explanation of dyad_ID000001: 
A dyad is a two-member group, representing the smallest possible social group. Dyads are characterised by intense interaction and mutual dependence between the two members, as each person's participation is crucial for the group's existence. The intimacy and directness of interaction in a dyad can lead to strong emotional bonds, but also to potential instability, as the withdrawal or loss of one member dissolves the group entirely. Decision-making in a dyad is often more direct and personal compared to larger groups, as there are only two perspectives to consider. However, disagreements can be more challenging to resolve without the possibility of a third-party mediator. Dyads play a fundamental role in social life, forming the basis of many close relationships, such as romantic partnerships and close friendships. The unique dynamics of dyads have been a subject of interest in sociology, particularly in the study of small group interactions.

Semantical explanation of primary_Socialisation_ID000002: 
Primary socialisation is the fundamental process by which children learn the basic cultural norms, values, beliefs, language, and behaviours of the society into which they are born, primarily occurring within the family and close-knit social environments during their early years. Through interaction with primary caregivers and other close family members, children develop their initial sense of self, learn how to communicate, and internalise the foundational norms and expectations of their culture, which are essential for functioning within that society. This stage of socialisation lays the groundwork for future learning and social development.

Semantical explanation of family_ID000006: 
A family is a group of individuals related to one another by blood ties, marriage, or adoption who form an economic unit, the adult members of which are responsible for the upbringing of children. All known societies involve some form of family system, although the nature of family relationships is widely variable across cultures and throughout history. While in modern societies the main family form is often considered the nuclear family (a couple and their dependent children), a variety of extended family relationships (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) are also frequently found and play important roles in individuals' lives. The family serves as a primary agent of socialisation, providing emotional support, care, and a sense of belonging for its members. It also plays a crucial role in the transmission of cultural norms, values, and traditions across generations.

Causal relation: {Primary_Socialisation, Family, Education} → socialises → {Identity, Values, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of education_ID000014: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility. Sociologists study education to understand its impact on social inequality, its relationship to the economy, and its role in shaping individual identities and life chances.

Causal relation: {Primary_Socialisation, Family, Education} → socialises → {Identity, Values, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of identity_ID000007: 
Identity refers to the distinctive characteristics of a person's character or the character of a group which relate to who they are and what is meaningful to them, providing a sense of self and belonging. Some of the main sources of identity include gender, encompassing social expectations of masculinity and femininity; sexual orientation, referring to patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction; nationality or ethnicity, based on shared cultural heritage, origin, and often language or religion; and social class, reflecting one's position in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Identity is not fixed but is fluid and can evolve over an individual's life course through interactions with others and within different social contexts. It shapes how individuals perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others, influencing their social interactions, opportunities, and experiences within society.

Causal relation: {Primary_Socialisation, Family, Education} → socialises → {Identity, Values, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of values_ID000006: 
Values are culturally defined standards or principles that are widely shared by members of a society or group and serve as broad guidelines for social living, indicating what people assess as desirable, good, beautiful, right, or important. Values provide a moral compass for behaviour, influencing people's attitudes, choices, and actions across various aspects of life, and they often form the basis for social norms, which are more specific rules and expectations for behaviour. Values can vary significantly across different cultures and can change over time within a society, reflecting evolving beliefs and priorities. They play a crucial role in shaping social cohesion, cultural identity, and the overall character of a society, and they are often transmitted from one generation to the next through the process of socialisation.

Causal relation: {Primary_Socialisation, Family, Education} → socialises → {Identity, Values, Social_Roles}

Semantical explanation of social_Roles_ID000004: 
Social_Roles represents the organised system of behavioural expectations, positions, and identities that individuals occupy within social structures and through which social interaction is organised and regulated. This category encompasses the fundamental mechanisms through which societies organise human behaviour and social relationships, including both positions that individuals achieve through their actions and those that are ascribed based on characteristics beyond their control. The concept includes the hierarchical dimension of social positions through status systems and the specialised behavioural expectations associated with particular social positions. Gender roles represent culturally defined expectations based on sex categories, while the sick role exemplifies how societies organise responses to illness and health conditions. Master status refers to dominant identity categories that override other social positions in social interaction. The category captures how societies create and maintain social order through the assignment and performance of differentiated roles that coordinate individual behaviour with collective needs and expectations. These roles serve as bridges between individual identity and social structure, providing frameworks for social interaction, identity formation, and the reproduction of social patterns across time and social contexts.

Causal relation: {Nuclear_Family, Extended_Family} → socialises → {Primary_Socialisation, Secondary_Socialisation}

Semantical explanation of nuclear_Family_ID000002: 
A nuclear family is a family group that consists of a mother, a father (or one of these parents in the case of single-parent families), and their dependent children living together in the same household. This family structure is often considered the traditional or dominant family form in many Western industrialised societies, although diverse family arrangements are increasingly common. The nuclear family is typically characterised by close emotional bonds, economic cooperation, and the responsibility of the adult members for the upbringing and well-being of their children. It plays a crucial role in the socialisation of children and provides a primary source of social support for its members.

Causal relation: {Nuclear_Family, Extended_Family} → socialises → {Primary_Socialisation, Secondary_Socialisation}

Semantical explanation of extended_Family_ID000002: 
An extended family is a family group consisting of close relatives extending beyond a couple and their children, living either within the same household or in a close and continuous relationship with one another. This can include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and other kin who play a significant role in the family's social and economic life. Extended family structures were more common in pre-industrial societies and in many cultures around the world, where they often provided a strong network of support, shared resources, and collective caregiving. While the nuclear family (a couple and their dependent children) has become more prevalent in many Western industrialised societies, extended family ties continue to be important for many individuals and can provide valuable social, emotional, and practical support.

Causal relation: {Nuclear_Family, Extended_Family} → socialises → {Primary_Socialisation, Secondary_Socialisation}

Semantical explanation of primary_Socialisation_ID000003: 
Primary socialisation is the fundamental process by which children learn the basic cultural norms, values, beliefs, language, and behaviours of the society into which they are born, primarily occurring within the family and close-knit social environments during their early years. Through interaction with primary caregivers and other close family members, children develop their initial sense of self, learn how to communicate, and internalise the foundational norms and expectations of their culture, which are essential for functioning within that society. This stage of socialisation lays the groundwork for future learning and social development.

Causal relation: {Nuclear_Family, Extended_Family} → socialises → {Primary_Socialisation, Secondary_Socialisation}

Semantical explanation of secondary_Socialisation_ID000002: 
Secondary Socialisation is the process of learning and internalizing the norms, values, behaviours, and roles that are specific to particular social groups, institutions, or contexts outside of the primary family environment. This stage of socialisation typically occurs during adolescence and adulthood, building upon the foundational learning acquired during primary socialisation. Key agents of secondary socialisation include schools (where individuals learn academic knowledge, punctuality, and conformity to formal rules), peer groups (influencing social behaviours, identity formation, and cultural trends), religious institutions (imparting moral beliefs and practices), and the workplace (socializing individuals into professional roles, organisational culture, and specific job responsibilities). Unlike the intimate and emotionally charged nature of primary socialisation, secondary socialisation often involves more impersonal and instrumental relationships, as individuals learn how to navigate diverse social settings and adopt appropriate behaviours for new roles and statuses in a complex society. It is a continuous process of adaptation and learning throughout the life course.

Semantical explanation of capitalists_ID000002: 
Capitalists are those who own companies, land, or stocks and shares, using these assets to generate economic returns or profits through investment and production. In a capitalist system, capitalists control the means of production and employ workers to produce goods and services, aiming to maximise their profits. They play a central role in the economy by investing capital and taking risks in the pursuit of economic growth. The relationship between capitalists and workers is often characterised by an imbalance of power, as capitalists own the resources necessary for production and workers depend on them for employment and wages.

Semantical explanation of bourgeoisie_ID000006: 
Bourgeoisie, in the theory of Karl Marx, refers to the capitalist class, comprising the owners of the means of production, such as factories, land, and capital. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie stands in opposition to the proletariat, or working class, who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie in order to survive.[1, 2] According to Marx, the bourgeoisie's primary goal is the accumulation of capital and profit, which they achieve through the exploitation of the proletariat. This class structure and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are central to Marx's critique of capitalism.

Causal relation: {Capitalists, Bourgeoisie} → owns → {Means_Of_Production, Monopoly}

Semantical explanation of means_Of_Production_ID000003: 
The means of production, a core concept in Marxist theory, refers to the resources, tools, technologies, land, factories, and other infrastructure whereby the production of material goods is carried on in a society. This concept encompasses not just the physical technology involved in production but also the social relations between the producers (e.g., the relationship between the owners of the means of production and the workers who use them). According to Marx, the ownership and control of the means of production are central to understanding the structure of society and the distribution of power and wealth. In capitalist societies, the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) owns and controls the means of production, while the proletariat (working class) must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie to survive, leading to inherent inequalities and class conflict.

Causal relation: {Capitalists, Bourgeoisie} → owns → {Means_Of_Production, Monopoly}

Semantical explanation of monopoly_ID000003: 
Monopoly refers to the control of a particular market or industry by a single business firm, giving that firm the power to dominate the market without significant competition. In a monopoly, the single firm is the sole producer or seller of a specific product or service, allowing it to set prices, control supply, and potentially limit consumer choice. This lack of competition can lead to higher prices, lower quality, and reduced innovation compared to markets with multiple competing firms. Monopolies can arise due to various factors, such as government regulations granting exclusive rights, the control of essential resources, high barriers to entry that prevent new firms from competing, or network effects where the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. While some monopolies may be considered natural due to inherent efficiencies of scale in certain industries, they are often subject to government regulation and antitrust laws aimed at preventing unfair competition and protecting consumer interests. The existence of a monopoly can have significant implications for the economy and society, affecting market dynamics, consumer welfare, and the distribution of wealth.

Unlike amateur or occasional offenders, professional criminals often plan their crimes carefully, work in organised groups or networks, and may have a long-term commitment to a life of crime. They often develop a code of conduct and may view their criminal activities as a career, acquiring expertise in specific types of crime such as theft, fraud, drug trafficking, or gambling.

Causal relation: {Professional_Criminal, Entrepreneur} → networks → {Social_Network, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of social_Network_ID000002: 
A social network refers to a series of interconnected social relationships that links an individual directly to other people and, through them, indirectly to an even wider circle of individuals, forming a complex web of social connections. These networks can be based on various types of relationships, including friendship, kinship, work affiliations, shared interests, or online interactions, and they facilitate the flow of information, resources, social support, and influence among the individuals within them. The structure and characteristics of an individual's social network, such as its size, density, and the strength of its ties, can have significant implications for their opportunities, well-being, and social capital, which is the collective benefit derived from social connections and relationships.

Causal relation: {Professional_Criminal, Entrepreneur} → networks → {Social_Network, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of social_Cohesion_ID000003: 
Social Cohesion refers to the degree of solidarity, unity, and sense of belonging that exists among individuals and groups within a society, reflecting the bonds that tie people together and enable them to live and work together effectively. It is characterised by shared values, common norms, mutual trust, and a willingness to cooperate for the collective good. Ã‰mile Durkheim identified two types of social cohesion: mechanical solidarity, found in traditional societies based on homogeneity and shared morality, and organic solidarity, prevalent in modern, complex societies based on interdependence and specialisation. High levels of social cohesion contribute to social stability, order, and collective well-being, fostering a sense of community and mutual support. Conversely, a lack of social cohesion can lead to social disorganisation, conflict, and a sense of anomie or normlessness among individuals.

Semantical explanation of survey_ID000001: 
A survey is a widely used method of sociological research that typically involves the systematic administration of a standardised set of questions, often in the form of questionnaires, to a sample of individuals drawn from a larger population being studied. The goal of a survey is to collect data on the attitudes, beliefs, behaviours, opinions, or characteristics of the population of interest through the responses provided by the sample members. The data collected through surveys is often analysed using statistical techniques to identify patterns, regularities, and relationships between variables within the population. Surveys can be conducted in various formats, including mail-in questionnaires, telephone interviews, face-to-face interviews, and online surveys, each with its own advantages and limitations in terms of cost, response rates, and the type of data that can be collected. The quality of a survey depends on factors such as the design of the questions, the selection of a representative sample, and the rate of response from the participants.

Semantical explanation of qualitative_Research_Methods_ID000001: 
Qualitative research methods are those sociological methods that primarily focus on gathering in-depth, detailed, and rich data, often in non-numerical form, with the primary aim of gaining a better understanding of the social phenomena being studied from the perspectives of the individuals or groups involved. These methods often involve exploring the 'why' and 'how' of social issues rather than just the 'what' or 'how many' that quantitative methods typically address. Common qualitative research methods include in-depth interviews, focus groups, participant observation, ethnography, and the analysis of textual or visual data. The goal of qualitative research is to provide a holistic and contextual understanding of social phenomena, uncovering meanings, patterns, and experiences in a detailed and nuanced way.

Semantical explanation of quantitative_Research_Methods_ID000001: 
Quantitative research methods are those sociological methods that primarily focus on collecting and analysing social phenomena using numerical data, mathematical models, statistical techniques, and computational methods to measure and quantify social patterns, relationships between variables, and the strength and direction of these relationships. These methods often involve the use of surveys with closed-ended questions, experiments with controlled variables, and the analysis of large datasets to identify trends, test hypotheses, and make generalisations about populations. The goal of quantitative research is often to establish statistical significance, identify causal relationships, and produce findings that can be generalised to a larger population.

Semantical explanation of representative_Sample_ID000001: 
A representative sample is a selection of individuals or cases drawn from a larger population that is statistically found to be typical of that population in terms of key characteristics relevant to the study, such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or opinions. The goal of obtaining a representative sample is to ensure that the findings from the sample can be generalised with a reasonable degree of accuracy to the entire population from which the sample was drawn, allowing researchers to make broader inferences and conclusions about the population as a whole. Various sampling techniques, including random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling, are used to try to achieve a representative sample.

Causal relation: {Interview, Biographical_Methods} → interviews → {Qualitative_Research, Life_Histories}

Semantical explanation of interview_ID000002: 
In sociological research, an interview is a method of data collection that involves a series of questions a researcher administers personally to respondents, either face-to-face, by telephone, or through video conferencing. Interviews can be structured, following a predetermined set of questions in a specific order, or unstructured, allowing for more open-ended conversation and exploration of topics. Semi-structured interviews combine elements of both approaches, using an interview guide with key questions but allowing for flexibility in probing responses and exploring related issues that may arise. Interviews are a valuable tool for gathering in-depth qualitative data about individuals' experiences, perspectives, attitudes, and beliefs, providing rich insights into social phenomena that may not be captured by quantitative methods like surveys. The success of an interview depends on the researcher's ability to establish rapport with the respondent, ask clear and unbiased questions, and actively listen to and record their responses accurately.

Semantical explanation of biographical_Methods_ID000001: 
Biographical methods involve research techniques that focus on collecting and analysing data related to individual lives or life experiences. These methods often include oral histories, where individuals recount their life stories in interviews; life stories, which are narrative accounts of a person's life, either told by themselves or others; autobiographies, which are self-written accounts of one's own life; and biographies, which are accounts of someone's life written by another person. Biographical methods aim to understand social phenomena from the perspective of individuals and to explore the meanings they attach to their experiences. They are particularly useful for studying life course transitions, personal narratives, and the impact of social and historical contexts on individual lives.

Semantical explanation of qualitative_Research_ID000003: 
Qualitative research is a research approach that primarily relies on data that is not numerical and often involves studying social phenomena in their natural settings or "in the field" rather than in controlled laboratory environments. This type of research seeks to understand the qualities, characteristics, and meanings of social phenomena through methods such as observation, interviews, and the analysis of texts or artifacts. The focus is often on exploring the depth and complexity of experiences, perspectives, and social processes, rather than on quantifying them through statistical data. Qualitative research aims to provide rich, descriptive insights into the social world and the ways in which people interpret and make sense of their experiences.

Causal relation: {Interview, Biographical_Methods} → interviews → {Qualitative_Research, Life_Histories}

Semantical explanation of life_Histories_ID000002: 
Life histories are in-depth studies of the overall lives of individuals, often using a qualitative research approach that gathers detailed information about a person's experiences, perspectives, and the significant events that have shaped their life course. These studies often rely on a combination of data sources, including self-reporting through interviews, personal narratives, and autobiographies, as well as documentary evidence such as letters, diaries, photographs, and official records. The goal of life history research is to understand the individual's life within its broader social, cultural, and historical context, exploring how personal experiences intersect with larger social forces and patterns. This method can provide rich insights into topics such as identity formation, social change, the impact of historical events on individuals, and the subjective meanings people attach to their lives.

Causal relation: {Apartheid, Institutional_Discrimination} → segregates → {Segregation, Defended_Neighborhood}

Semantical explanation of apartheid_ID000002: 
Apartheid was the former policy of the South African government designed to maintain the separation of Blacks and other non-Whites from the dominant Whites. This system of racial segregation and discrimination was implemented through legislation that classified people into racial groups and enforced their separation in all aspects of life, including housing, education, employment, healthcare, and political participation. The apartheid regime systematically privileged the White minority and subjected the Black majority to severe oppression and denial of basic human rights. This policy was in effect from 1948 to 1994 and drew widespread international condemnation, leading to various sanctions and boycotts against South Africa. The dismantling of apartheid began in the early 1990s with the release of Nelson Mandela and the subsequent reforms that led to multiracial elections and the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa. The legacy of apartheid continues to impact South African society, with ongoing efforts to address the deep-seated inequalities and social divisions created by this discriminatory system.

Causal relation: {Apartheid, Institutional_Discrimination} → segregates → {Segregation, Defended_Neighborhood}

Semantical explanation of institutional_Discrimination_ID000003: 
Institutional discrimination refers to the denial of opportunities and equal rights to individuals and groups that results from the normal operations of a society's institutions, such as schools, workplaces, healthcare systems, and the legal system, rather than from overt acts of individual prejudice. This form of discrimination is often embedded in established policies, procedures, and practices that may appear neutral on the surface but systematically disadvantage certain groups based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. For example, standardised testing in education that is culturally biased may disproportionately disadvantage students from certain minority groups, limiting their access to higher education. Similarly, hiring practices that rely heavily on personal networks may exclude qualified candidates who lack connections to the dominant group within an industry. Institutional discrimination can be subtle and often unintentional, but its cumulative effect can be significant in perpetuating social inequalities.

Causal relation: {Apartheid, Institutional_Discrimination} → segregates → {Segregation, Defended_Neighborhood}

Semantical explanation of segregation_ID000003: 
Segregation refers to the act and process of physically, socially, or legally separating two or more groups of people, often based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or socioeconomic status. While segregation can occur in various forms, it is frequently imposed on a minority group by a dominant group within a society, leading to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social institutions such as housing, education, healthcare, and employment. Segregation can be enforced through explicit laws and policies (de jure segregation) or through informal social norms and practices (de facto segregation). It often results in social isolation, limited intergroup contact, and the perpetuation of inequalities between the separated groups. The history of segregation in various parts of the world, such as racial segregation in the United States and apartheid in South Africa, demonstrates its profound and lasting negative impacts on marginalised groups and society as a whole.

Causal relation: {Apartheid, Institutional_Discrimination} → segregates → {Segregation, Defended_Neighborhood}

Semantical explanation of defended_Neighborhood_ID000001: 
A defended neighborhood is a neighborhood that residents identify through defined community borders and through a perception that adjacent areas are geographically separate and socially different. This concept highlights the social construction of neighborhood boundaries and the sense of territoriality and identity that residents develop in relation to their local area. Residents of a defended neighborhood often feel a strong sense of belonging and may actively work to maintain the perceived social and physical boundaries of their community, sometimes in response to perceived threats or differences from neighboring areas. This can involve social activities, community organisations, and even informal surveillance to reinforce the neighborhood's identity and distinctiveness. The concept of a defended neighborhood is relevant to understanding urban sociology, community studies, and issues related to social cohesion and inter-neighborhood relations. The perceived differences between a defended neighborhood and adjacent areas can be based on factors such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, lifestyle, or levels of crime.

Causal relation: {Racism, Ethnic_Group} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of racism_ID000004: 
Racism is the attribution of characteristics of superiority or inferiority to a population sharing certain physically inherited characteristics, often leading to prejudice, discrimination, and the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over others. It is a complex system of power and ideology that operates at individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels, based on the social construction of racial categories and the belief that these categories are biologically real and associated with distinct traits, abilities, or moral character. Racism can manifest as overt acts of discrimination and hate speech, as well as in more subtle forms of bias embedded in social structures, policies, and practices that perpetuate racial inequalities in areas such as education, employment, housing, and the criminal justice system. It is a pervasive and harmful social phenomenon with deep historical roots and lasting consequences for individuals and societies.

Causal relation: {Racism, Ethnic_Group} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of ethnic_Group_ID000003: 
An ethnic group is a group of people who are set apart from others because of their shared national origin or distinctive cultural patterns, which can include language, religion, traditions, customs, and shared history. Members of an ethnic group typically share a sense of common identity and belonging based on these cultural elements, which distinguish them from other groups in society. Ethnicity is a social construct, meaning that it is defined and maintained through social interaction and cultural practices rather than being based on fixed biological traits. The boundaries of ethnic groups can be fluid and may change over time due to factors such as migration, intermarriage, and social and political contexts. The study of ethnic groups is central to understanding cultural diversity, intergroup relations, and issues of identity and belonging in sociology.

Causal relation: {Racism, Ethnic_Group} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of social_Stratification_ID000008: 
Social stratification refers to the existence of structured inequalities between different groups in society in terms of their access to material or symbolic rewards, such as wealth, income, prestige, power, status, and opportunities. While some forms of social differentiation may exist in all societies, significant and enduring patterns of inequality, leading to hierarchical arrangements of social groups, tend to arise with the development of more complex, state-based systems. The most distinctive and extensively studied form of stratification in modern societies involves class divisions, based primarily on economic factors, but stratification can also occur along lines of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and other social categories. Sociologists examine the causes and consequences of social stratification, as well as the processes that maintain or challenge these inequalities over time.

Causal relation: {Racism, Ethnic_Group} → stratifies → {Social_Stratification, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000007: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Racism} → discriminatesAgainst → {Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of minority_Group_ID000004: 
A minority group is a group of people in a minority in a given society who, because of their distinct physical or cultural characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability, find themselves in situations of inequality or disadvantage within that society. Membership in a minority group is typically ascribed rather than achieved, and these groups often experience discrimination, prejudice, and limited access to power and resources compared to the dominant or majority group. The term "minority" in this sociological context does not necessarily refer to a group's numerical size but rather to its subordinate status and lack of social, economic, and political power. Minority groups often develop a strong sense of group solidarity and shared identity in response to their experiences of marginalisation.

Causal relation: {Rehabilitation, Capital_Punishment} → influencesHistorically → {Crime, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of rehabilitation_ID000002: 
Rehabilitation, in the context of criminology and sociology, refers to a planned and systematic program or process aimed at reforming an offender's attitudes, behaviours, and skills in order to reduce the likelihood of future offenses and facilitate their reintegration into society as law-abiding citizens. Rehabilitation programs can take various forms, including educational and vocational training, therapy and counseling to address underlying issues contributing to criminal behaviour (such as substance abuse or mental health problems), and restorative justice initiatives that focus on repairing the harm caused by the crime and promoting empathy and accountability. The goal of rehabilitation is to address the root causes of crime and provide offenders with the tools and support they need to lead productive and crime-free lives upon release from correctional facilities or completion of their sentences.

Causal relation: {Rehabilitation, Capital_Punishment} → influencesHistorically → {Crime, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of capital_Punishment_ID000002: 
Capital punishment is the state-sanctioned execution of a person who has been convicted of a crime that is punishable by death. Commonly known as the 'death penalty', it is a highly debated topic with strong ethical, moral, and legal arguments both for and against its use. Proponents often argue for its effectiveness as a deterrent to crime and as a just retribution for heinous offenses, while opponents raise concerns about its irreversibility, potential for error, and moral implications, often citing issues of human rights and cruel and unusual punishment. The application of capital punishment varies significantly across countries and jurisdictions, with differing views on which crimes warrant such a severe penalty.

Causal relation: {Rehabilitation, Capital_Punishment} → influencesHistorically → {Crime, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of crime_ID000006: 
Crime is a violation of criminal law for which formal penalties are applied by some governmental authority. What constitutes a crime is defined by legal statutes at the local, state, or federal level, and these definitions can vary across jurisdictions and change over time. Crimes are typically classified based on their severity, ranging from minor offenses (misdemeanors) to serious felonies. The criminal justice system, including law enforcement agencies, courts, and correctional institutions, is responsible for enforcing criminal laws, apprehending offenders, and administering penalties, which can include fines, probation, imprisonment, or, in some cases, capital punishment. Sociologists study crime from various perspectives, examining its social causes, patterns, and consequences, as well as the functioning of the criminal justice system and its impact on society.

Causal relation: {Rehabilitation, Capital_Punishment} → influencesHistorically → {Crime, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000008: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Semantical explanation of religion_ID000001: 
Religion is a complex and multifaceted social institution that involves a set of beliefs adhered to by the members of a community, typically involving symbols that are regarded with a sense of awe, wonder, or the sacred, along with ritual practices in which members of the community collectively engage to express and reinforce their shared beliefs and values. It often provides a framework for understanding the world, the meaning of life, and the nature of ultimate reality, and can include a moral code, a system of ethics, and a sense of community among believers. Religious beliefs are statements or doctrines to which members of a particular religion adhere, providing a cognitive framework for their faith. Religious experience refers to the subjective feeling or perception of being in direct contact with the ultimate reality, such as a divine being, or of being overcome by intense religious emotion, often considered a powerful and transformative aspect of religious life. Religious rituals are the practices, ceremonies, and behaviours that are required or expected of members of a faith, often performed collectively and imbued with symbolic meaning, serving to reinforce beliefs, create social bonds, and connect individuals to the sacred.

Causal relation: {Religion} → socialises → {Socialisation}

Semantical explanation of socialisation_ID000005: 
Socialisation refers to the lifelong social processes through which individuals develop an awareness of social norms, values, beliefs, and behaviours of their culture and society, and achieve a distinct sense of self and identity. This process begins in early childhood with primary socialisation within the family, where children learn basic language, social skills, and cultural norms from parents and close relatives. As individuals grow, they continue to be socialised through secondary agents such as schools, peer groups, the media, religion, and the workplace, learning the more specific roles, expectations, and behaviours associated with different social contexts and stages of life. Socialisation is crucial for individuals to become integrated members of their society and for the transmission of culture across generations.

Causal relation: {Religion, Traditional_Authority} → transmits → {Sacred, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of traditional_Authority_ID000002: 
Traditional authority, as defined by Max Weber, is a form of legitimate power that is conferred by custom, established traditions, and accepted practices that have been passed down over time. This type of authority is often associated with hereditary leadership, where the right to rule is inherited through family lineage and is accepted as legitimate because it has always been that way. Obedience is owed to the person in authority due to their traditional status and the sanctity of established customs, rather than based on their personal charisma or legally defined rules. Examples of traditional authority can be found in monarchies where power is passed down through royal families, or in traditional tribal societies where leadership is based on long-standing customs and norms. Weber contrasted traditional authority with charismatic authority, which is based on the exceptional personal appeal of a leader, and rational-legal authority, which is based on formally established rules and laws.

Causal relation: {Religion, Traditional_Authority} → transmits → {Sacred, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of sacred_ID000001: 
The sacred, in the sociological study of religion, refers to those aspects of life, including objects, places, times, symbols, and beliefs, that inspire attitudes of awe, reverence, respect, and even fear among believers in a given set of religious ideas. The sacred is set apart from the ordinary and mundane aspects of everyday existence, which are considered profane. Ã‰mile Durkheim emphasised the fundamental distinction between the sacred and the profane as the basis of religious life, arguing that the sacred represents the collective beliefs and values of a society, fostering social solidarity and a sense of shared identity among members of a religious community. Rituals and ceremonies often revolve around the sacred, reinforcing its significance and the emotional bonds between believers.

Causal relation: {Religion, Traditional_Authority} → transmits → {Sacred, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of social_Cohesion_ID000004: 
Social Cohesion refers to the degree of solidarity, unity, and sense of belonging that exists among individuals and groups within a society, reflecting the bonds that tie people together and enable them to live and work together effectively. It is characterised by shared values, common norms, mutual trust, and a willingness to cooperate for the collective good. Ã‰mile Durkheim identified two types of social cohesion: mechanical solidarity, found in traditional societies based on homogeneity and shared morality, and organic solidarity, prevalent in modern, complex societies based on interdependence and specialisation. High levels of social cohesion contribute to social stability, order, and collective well-being, fostering a sense of community and mutual support. Conversely, a lack of social cohesion can lead to social disorganisation, conflict, and a sense of anomie or normlessness among individuals.

Causal relation: {Church, Denomination} → institutionalises → {Religious_Organisations, Religion}

Semantical explanation of church_ID000001: 
A church is a large body of people belonging to an established religious organisation. Churches normally have a formal structure, with a hierarchy of religious officials, and the term is also used for the building where their religious ceremonials are held. Churches tend to be well-integrated into the broader society and often have a significant influence on social norms and values. They typically have a long history and established doctrines and practices. In sociological terms, a church is often contrasted with other types of religious organisations, such as sects and cults, which tend to be smaller, less formally organised, and may have more unconventional beliefs or practices. Churches often play a role in providing social services, education, and community support to their members.

Causal relation: {Church, Denomination} → institutionalises → {Religious_Organisations, Religion}

Semantical explanation of denomination_ID000001: 
A denomination is a large, organised religion that is not officially linked with the state or government, operating independently and typically accepting the existence of other religious groups within a pluralistic society. Unlike a state church, which is officially endorsed and supported by the government, a denomination maintains its own governance and financial autonomy. While denominations may have a significant presence and influence within a society, they do not hold a position of exclusive authority or official recognition by the state. They generally have a well-established history, a large membership base, and a formal organisational structure with defined doctrines and practices. The concept of denomination is particularly relevant in countries with a separation of church and state and a diverse religious landscape, such as the United States, where numerous Christian denominations, as well as other major religions, operate freely.

Semantical explanation of religious_Organisations_ID000001: 
Religious_Organisations encompasses collective entities formed around shared spiritual beliefs, religious practices, and faith traditions that provide meaning, community, and moral guidance to their members. These aggregates vary in their relationship to broader society, from established institutions that are well-integrated into mainstream culture to newer movements that may challenge conventional religious practices. They serve multiple functions including spiritual instruction, community support, ritual facilitation, and moral authority within their respective communities. The diversity within this category reflects different approaches to religious organisation, from hierarchical institutional structures to more informal or innovative religious movements. These organisations play crucial roles in transmitting religious traditions, providing social support networks, and offering frameworks for understanding life's fundamental questions and moral challenges.

Causal relation: {Church, Denomination} → institutionalises → {Religious_Organisations, Religion}

Semantical explanation of religion_ID000003: 
Religion is a complex and multifaceted social institution that involves a set of beliefs adhered to by the members of a community, typically involving symbols that are regarded with a sense of awe, wonder, or the sacred, along with ritual practices in which members of the community collectively engage to express and reinforce their shared beliefs and values. It often provides a framework for understanding the world, the meaning of life, and the nature of ultimate reality, and can include a moral code, a system of ethics, and a sense of community among believers. Religious beliefs are statements or doctrines to which members of a particular religion adhere, providing a cognitive framework for their faith. Religious experience refers to the subjective feeling or perception of being in direct contact with the ultimate reality, such as a divine being, or of being overcome by intense religious emotion, often considered a powerful and transformative aspect of religious life. Religious rituals are the practices, ceremonies, and behaviours that are required or expected of members of a faith, often performed collectively and imbued with symbolic meaning, serving to reinforce beliefs, create social bonds, and connect individuals to the sacred.

Causal relation: {Secularisation, Modernisation} → regulates → {Religion, Religious_Organisations}

Semantical explanation of secularisation_ID000001: 
Secularisation is a complex and multifaceted process of decline in the social and cultural influence of religion in modern societies. While many contemporary societies have become increasingly secular, the extent and nature of secularisation are subjects of ongoing sociological debate and research. Secularisation can be observed and measured in various ways, including a decrease in levels of individual involvement with religious organisations (such as lower rates of church attendance and religious affiliation), a reduction in the social and material influence wielded by religious institutions in areas like politics, education, and social welfare, and a decline in the degree to which people hold traditional religious beliefs and adhere to religious practices in their personal lives. Secularisation does not necessarily mean the complete disappearance of religion, but rather a shift in its role and significance in society and individual lives, often leading to a greater separation between religious and secular spheres of life.

Causal relation: {Secularisation, Modernisation} → regulates → {Religion, Religious_Organisations}

Semantical explanation of modernisation_ID000001: 
Modernisation is a far-reaching and complex process by which a society undergoes a fundamental transformation from traditional or less developed institutions, social structures, and cultural practices to those characteristic of more developed, industrialised, and often urbanised societies. This process typically involves significant changes in various aspects of social life, including the economy (shift from agriculture to industry), political systems (often towards democracy and increased state capacity), social structures (greater social mobility and differentiation), cultural values (emphasis on individualism, secularism, and rationality), and technology (adoption of advanced technologies). Modernisation is often associated with improvements in living standards, education, healthcare, and overall societal complexity, but it can also bring about social disruptions, inequalities, and challenges to traditional ways of life. Sociologists study modernisation to understand its causes, consequences, and the different paths that societies take in this transformative process.

Semantical explanation of values_ID000007: 
Values are culturally defined standards or principles that are widely shared by members of a society or group and serve as broad guidelines for social living, indicating what people assess as desirable, good, beautiful, right, or important. Values provide a moral compass for behaviour, influencing people's attitudes, choices, and actions across various aspects of life, and they often form the basis for social norms, which are more specific rules and expectations for behaviour. Values can vary significantly across different cultures and can change over time within a society, reflecting evolving beliefs and priorities. They play a crucial role in shaping social cohesion, cultural identity, and the overall character of a society, and they are often transmitted from one generation to the next through the process of socialisation.

Causal relation: {Religion, Religious_Rituals} → socialises → {Values, Socialisation}

Semantical explanation of socialisation_ID000006: 
Socialisation refers to the lifelong social processes through which individuals develop an awareness of social norms, values, beliefs, and behaviours of their culture and society, and achieve a distinct sense of self and identity. This process begins in early childhood with primary socialisation within the family, where children learn basic language, social skills, and cultural norms from parents and close relatives. As individuals grow, they continue to be socialised through secondary agents such as schools, peer groups, the media, religion, and the workplace, learning the more specific roles, expectations, and behaviours associated with different social contexts and stages of life. Socialisation is crucial for individuals to become integrated members of their society and for the transmission of culture across generations.

Causal relation: {Resource_Mobilisation, Social_Network} → mobilises → {Social_Movement, Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of resource_Mobilisation_ID000003: 
Resource mobilisation theory (RMT) is a major theoretical perspective in the study of social movements that emphasises the crucial role of resourcesâ€”such as money, political influence, access to the media, personnel (volunteers and staff), and communication networksâ€”in the emergence, growth, and success of social movements. RMT argues that grievances or social discontent are widespread and are not sufficient on their own to explain the development of social movements; rather, it is the ability of aggrieved groups to mobilise and effectively utilise various types of resources that determines whether a social movement will form and achieve its goals. This theory focuses on the strategic actions of social movement organisations in acquiring, organizing, and deploying resources to challenge existing power structures and bring about social change.

Causal relation: {Resource_Mobilisation, Social_Network} → mobilises → {Social_Movement, Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of social_Network_ID000003: 
A social network refers to a series of interconnected social relationships that links an individual directly to other people and, through them, indirectly to an even wider circle of individuals, forming a complex web of social connections. These networks can be based on various types of relationships, including friendship, kinship, work affiliations, shared interests, or online interactions, and they facilitate the flow of information, resources, social support, and influence among the individuals within them. The structure and characteristics of an individual's social network, such as its size, density, and the strength of its ties, can have significant implications for their opportunities, well-being, and social capital, which is the collective benefit derived from social connections and relationships.

Causal relation: {Resource_Mobilisation, Social_Network} → mobilises → {Social_Movement, Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of social_Movement_ID000004: 
A social movement encompasses collective attempts by a group of people to further a common interest or secure a shared goal through organised action that typically takes place outside the sphere of established political institutions and conventional channels. These movements often arise in response to perceived social, economic, or political grievances and seek to bring about or resist social change, existing in a dynamic relationship, often one of conflict, with organisations or power structures whose objectives and outlook they frequently oppose. Social movements can vary widely in their goals, tactics, organisational structures, and the scale of change they aim to achieve, ranging from advocating for specific policy reforms to seeking fundamental transformations in societal norms and values. While they operate outside of formal political systems, successful social movements can sometimes influence policy and, if they manage to gain significant power and become institutionalised, may evolve into formal organisations or even political parties.

Causal relation: {Resource_Mobilisation, Social_Network} → mobilises → {Social_Movement, Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of collective_Behaviour_ID000004: 
Collective behaviour encompasses activities of people and social groups that typically emerge spontaneously (such as crowds, riots, and so on) rather than arising from established processes of socialisation leading to conformity to social rules and norms. These behaviours often occur in response to a shared situation or stimulus and can involve large numbers of people acting in relatively unstructured ways. Examples of collective behaviour include panics, fads, rumors, social movements, and disasters. Sociologists study collective behaviour to understand the dynamics of group actions that are not governed by typical social structures or institutions. Factors such as anonymity, suggestibility, and the rapid spread of information can play a significant role in shaping collective behaviour.

Semantical explanation of political_Action_Committee_(PAC)_ID000004: 
A political action committee (PAC) is a political committee that is typically established by an interest groupâ€”such as a national bank, corporation, trade association, cooperative, or membership associationâ€”for the specific purpose of soliciting and distributing financial contributions to candidates running for political office or to political parties. PACs are a significant part of the campaign finance system in many democracies, allowing organised groups to pool resources and support candidates who align with their interests and policy objectives. The regulations governing PACs, including the amount of money they can raise and contribute, vary depending on the jurisdiction.

Semantical explanation of strike_ID000002: 
A strike is a temporary stoppage of work or a collective withdrawal of labor by a group of workers or employees from their workplace as a form of protest or to exert pressure on their employer to meet specific demands or grievances, such as for better wages, improved working conditions, job security, or other employment-related issues. Strikes are a key tactic used by labor unions as part of collective bargaining to negotiate with employers and advocate for the rights and interests of their members. The decision to strike is often a significant one, involving a collective vote by union members, and it can have economic and social consequences for both the workers and the employer.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Society} → migrates → {Migration, Demographic_Transition}

Semantical explanation of urbanisation_ID000002: 
Urbanisation refers to the process of the development of towns and cities, typically involving the growth in the size and population of urban areas and the increasing concentration of people living and working in these areas. This process is often linked to economic development, industrialisation, and the migration of people from rural to urban areas in search of opportunities. Urbanisation leads to significant transformations in land use, infrastructure development, social organisation, and lifestyles, creating complex urban environments that serve as centers of economic, political, and cultural activity. The study of urbanisation examines its causes, patterns, and consequences for societies, including issues related to urban planning, housing, transportation, social inequality, and environmental sustainability.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Society} → migrates → {Migration, Demographic_Transition}

Semantical explanation of industrial_Society_ID000002: 
An industrial society is a type of society that depends primarily on mechanisation, advanced technology, and sophisticated machinery powered by advanced energy sources to produce its economic goods and services on a large scale. This form of society emerged with the Industrial Revolution and is characterised by a complex division of labor, a high degree of urbanisation as people move to centers of production, and a reliance on manufacturing and industrial processes rather than agriculture as the main source of economic activity. Industrial societies typically have a more complex social structure with greater social mobility compared to pre-industrial societies, although they can also experience significant social inequalities related to the distribution of wealth and power in the industrial economy. The development of industrial societies has led to significant increases in productivity, material wealth, and standards of living in many parts of the world, but also to new social and environmental challenges.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Society} → migrates → {Migration, Demographic_Transition}

Semantical explanation of migration_ID000005: 
Migration refers to the movement of people into and out of a particular territory, which can occur within a country (internal migration) or across national borders (international migration). This movement can be temporary or permanent and can be driven by a variety of factors, including economic opportunities, political instability, environmental changes, social networks, and personal aspirations. Immigration involves the movement of people into a new country to settle, while emigration refers to the movement of people out of a country to live elsewhere. Migration patterns can have significant demographic, economic, social, and cultural impacts on both the areas of origin and the areas of destination, influencing population size and composition, labor markets, cultural diversity, and social integration. Sociologists study migration to understand its causes and consequences, the experiences of migrants, and the policies and social responses to migration flows.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Society} → migrates → {Migration, Demographic_Transition}

Semantical explanation of demographic_Transition_ID000001: 
Demographic transition is an interpretation of population change, which holds that a stable ratio of births to deaths is achieved once a certain level of economic prosperity and modernisation has been reached. This process involves a shift from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as a society develops economically and socially. The transition typically occurs in stages, as described in the demographic transition theory, moving from a period of high fertility and mortality to one of low fertility and mortality, with a period of rapid population growth in between when death rates decline before birth rates do. The end result is a stabilisation of the population at a new size, often larger than the pre-transition level, with a different age structure. Factors contributing to this transition include improvements in healthcare, sanitation, education, and changes in cultural norms and values related to family size. Understanding the demographic transition is crucial for analysing population trends, planning for resource allocation, and addressing social and economic challenges associated with population change.

Causal relation: {Science} → innovates → {Innovation}

Semantical explanation of science_ID000002: 
Science is a systematic and logical system of acquiring knowledge about the natural and social world that bases its understanding on direct, systematic observation, empirical evidence, experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses and theories. It is characterised by its commitment to objectivity, empirical verification, and a self-correcting process where new evidence can lead to the revision or rejection of existing knowledge. The scientific method provides a structured approach to conducting research, ensuring rigor and minimizing bias in the pursuit of understanding how the world works. In sociology, science aims to apply these principles to the study of social behaviour, social structures, and social phenomena to develop reliable and valid knowledge about the social world.

Causal relation: {Science} → innovates → {Innovation}

Semantical explanation of innovation_ID000006: 
Innovation is the process of introducing new elements, ideas, methods, or products into a culture or society, leading to change and often improvement. This can occur through two primary mechanisms: discovery and invention. Discovery involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown or unrecognised, such as a new scientific fact or a previously unknown natural resource. Invention, on the other hand, involves creating something entirely new that did not exist before, such as a new technology, a new tool, or a new process. Both discovery and invention can have profound impacts on a culture, leading to new practices, beliefs, social structures, and material advancements. The rate and nature of innovation can vary significantly across different societies and historical periods, influenced by factors such as technological development, cultural values, and social organisation.

Causal relation: {Segregation} → segregates → {Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of segregation_ID000004: 
Segregation refers to the act and process of physically, socially, or legally separating two or more groups of people, often based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or socioeconomic status. While segregation can occur in various forms, it is frequently imposed on a minority group by a dominant group within a society, leading to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social institutions such as housing, education, healthcare, and employment. Segregation can be enforced through explicit laws and policies (de jure segregation) or through informal social norms and practices (de facto segregation). It often results in social isolation, limited intergroup contact, and the perpetuation of inequalities between the separated groups. The history of segregation in various parts of the world, such as racial segregation in the United States and apartheid in South Africa, demonstrates its profound and lasting negative impacts on marginalised groups and society as a whole.

Causal relation: {Segregation} → segregates → {Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000008: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Law refers to governmental social control, representing a formal system of rules and regulations enacted and enforced by political authorities to govern behaviour and maintain social order within a society. Laws are typically written down and specify both the behaviours that are prohibited or required and the sanctions or penalties that will be applied when violations occur. The legal system includes various institutions, such as legislatures that create laws, law enforcement agencies that enforce them, and courts that interpret laws and adjudicate disputes. Law plays a crucial role in establishing norms, resolving conflicts, protecting rights, and providing a framework for social interaction in complex societies. The legitimacy and effectiveness of law depend on its acceptance by the people it governs and its consistent and fair application.

Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Causal relation: {Law, Social_Control} → controls → {Crime, Formal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of crime_ID000007: 
Crime is a violation of criminal law for which formal penalties are applied by some governmental authority. What constitutes a crime is defined by legal statutes at the local, state, or federal level, and these definitions can vary across jurisdictions and change over time. Crimes are typically classified based on their severity, ranging from minor offenses (misdemeanors) to serious felonies. The criminal justice system, including law enforcement agencies, courts, and correctional institutions, is responsible for enforcing criminal laws, apprehending offenders, and administering penalties, which can include fines, probation, imprisonment, or, in some cases, capital punishment. Sociologists study crime from various perspectives, examining its social causes, patterns, and consequences, as well as the functioning of the criminal justice system and its impact on society.

Semantical explanation of formal_Social_Control_ID000004: 
Formal social control refers to the mechanisms and processes used by authorised agents and institutions within society to maintain order, enforce laws, and ensure conformity to established norms and rules. These agents include police officers, judges, school administrators, employers, and other individuals who have been given the authority to enforce social norms and impose sanctions when violations occur. Formal social control is characterised by its reliance on written rules, laws, and regulations, as well as established procedures for identifying and punishing deviant behaviour. Examples of formal social control mechanisms include arrests, prosecutions, disciplinary actions, and legal penalties. It plays a crucial role in maintaining social stability and protecting societal values and interests, often working in conjunction with informal social control mechanisms, such as social disapproval and peer pressure.

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000010: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Causal relation: {Social_Control, Formal_Social_Control} → controls → {Deviance, Informal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of formal_Social_Control_ID000005: 
Formal social control refers to the mechanisms and processes used by authorised agents and institutions within society to maintain order, enforce laws, and ensure conformity to established norms and rules. These agents include police officers, judges, school administrators, employers, and other individuals who have been given the authority to enforce social norms and impose sanctions when violations occur. Formal social control is characterised by its reliance on written rules, laws, and regulations, as well as established procedures for identifying and punishing deviant behaviour. Examples of formal social control mechanisms include arrests, prosecutions, disciplinary actions, and legal penalties. It plays a crucial role in maintaining social stability and protecting societal values and interests, often working in conjunction with informal social control mechanisms, such as social disapproval and peer pressure.

Causal relation: {Social_Control, Formal_Social_Control} → controls → {Deviance, Informal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of deviance_ID000006: 
Deviance refers to behaviour that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society. What is considered deviant varies across cultures, social groups, and time periods, as it is defined by social norms and values. Deviant behaviour can range from minor infractions of social norms to serious violations of laws. Sociologists study deviance to understand why people violate norms, how societies react to deviance, and the role of deviance in social change. Various theories attempt to explain deviance, including anomie theory, differential association theory, control theory, and labeling theory. Deviance is not inherently negative; while some deviant acts are harmful, others can challenge existing norms and lead to social progress.

Causal relation: {Social_Control, Formal_Social_Control} → controls → {Deviance, Informal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of informal_Social_Control_ID000001: 
Informal social control refers to the ways in which people casually enforce social norms and expectations through everyday interactions and social sanctions, such as laughter, smiles, ridicule, gossip, and expressions of approval or disapproval. This type of social control operates through interpersonal relationships and social pressure within families, peer groups, communities, and other informal social settings. It relies on the desire for social acceptance and the fear of social ostracism to encourage conformity to social norms. While informal social control may not involve formal punishments like legal sanctions, it can be very effective in shaping individual behaviour and maintaining social order at the micro-level of social interaction. The specific forms and effectiveness of informal social control can vary across different cultures and social groups.

Semantical explanation of law_ID000008: 
Law refers to governmental social control, representing a formal system of rules and regulations enacted and enforced by political authorities to govern behaviour and maintain social order within a society. Laws are typically written down and specify both the behaviours that are prohibited or required and the sanctions or penalties that will be applied when violations occur. The legal system includes various institutions, such as legislatures that create laws, law enforcement agencies that enforce them, and courts that interpret laws and adjudicate disputes. Law plays a crucial role in establishing norms, resolving conflicts, protecting rights, and providing a framework for social interaction in complex societies. The legitimacy and effectiveness of law depend on its acceptance by the people it governs and its consistent and fair application.

Causal relation: {Social_Control, Law} → regulates → {Deviance, Crime}

Semantical explanation of crime_ID000008: 
Crime is a violation of criminal law for which formal penalties are applied by some governmental authority. What constitutes a crime is defined by legal statutes at the local, state, or federal level, and these definitions can vary across jurisdictions and change over time. Crimes are typically classified based on their severity, ranging from minor offenses (misdemeanors) to serious felonies. The criminal justice system, including law enforcement agencies, courts, and correctional institutions, is responsible for enforcing criminal laws, apprehending offenders, and administering penalties, which can include fines, probation, imprisonment, or, in some cases, capital punishment. Sociologists study crime from various perspectives, examining its social causes, patterns, and consequences, as well as the functioning of the criminal justice system and its impact on society.

Causal relation: {Norms, Language} → coordinates → {Collective_Behaviour, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of norms_ID000001: 
Norms are the rules, standards, and expectations of behaviour that are widely shared and understood within a society or group, guiding the actions and interactions of its members and defining what is considered acceptable, appropriate, and desirable in various social situations. Norms can be formal, such as laws and written rules with specific sanctions for violations, or informal, such as customs, traditions, and social etiquette that are maintained through social approval or disapproval. They provide a framework for social order and cohesion, helping individuals to anticipate how others will behave and to know how they themselves are expected to act. Norms vary across cultures and can change over time within a society, reflecting evolving values and beliefs.

Causal relation: {Norms, Language} → coordinates → {Collective_Behaviour, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of language_ID000002: 
Language is an abstract and complex system of word meanings, symbols, and rules (grammar) that are shared by members of a culture and used for communication and representing all aspects of that culture. It is not limited to spoken or written words but also includes gestures, facial expressions, and other forms of nonverbal communication that convey meaning within a social context. Language is fundamental to human interaction, social organisation, and the transmission of culture from one generation to the next. It shapes how we think, perceive the world, and construct our social reality. The diversity of human languages reflects the rich tapestry of human cultures and the different ways in which societies have developed to understand and interact with their environments.

Causal relation: {Norms, Language} → coordinates → {Collective_Behaviour, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of collective_Behaviour_ID000005: 
Collective behaviour encompasses activities of people and social groups that typically emerge spontaneously (such as crowds, riots, and so on) rather than arising from established processes of socialisation leading to conformity to social rules and norms. These behaviours often occur in response to a shared situation or stimulus and can involve large numbers of people acting in relatively unstructured ways. Examples of collective behaviour include panics, fads, rumors, social movements, and disasters. Sociologists study collective behaviour to understand the dynamics of group actions that are not governed by typical social structures or institutions. Factors such as anonymity, suggestibility, and the rapid spread of information can play a significant role in shaping collective behaviour.

Causal relation: {Norms, Language} → coordinates → {Collective_Behaviour, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of social_Structure_ID000003: 
Social structure refers to the underlying patterns of social relationships, institutions, and social organisation that shape and constrain individuals' behaviour and interactions within a society, providing a framework for social life. It is the way in which a society is organised into predictable relationships and hierarchies based on factors such as social class, gender, race, ethnicity, age, and social institutions like the family, education, government, and the economy. Social structure is not always immediately visible but exerts a powerful influence on individuals' opportunities, experiences, and life chances. Sociologists study social structure to understand the enduring patterns of social behaviour and the ways in which society is organised at a macro level.

Causal relation: {Negotiation, Conflict_Perspective} → coordinates → {Social_Movement, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of negotiation_ID000001: 
Negotiation is a fundamental social process that involves the attempt by two or more parties with differing interests or goals to reach a mutually acceptable agreement concerning some objective, issue, or course of action. It typically involves communication, discussion, and bargaining, where each party may make concessions or compromises to find a common ground that satisfies their essential needs or interests. Negotiation can occur in various contexts, from interpersonal relationships and business transactions to political and international relations. The success of negotiation often depends on factors such as the parties' willingness to compromise, their communication skills, their understanding of each other's needs and interests, and the power dynamics between them. It is a key mechanism for conflict resolution, cooperation, and the achievement of shared goals in diverse social settings.

Causal relation: {Negotiation, Conflict_Perspective} → coordinates → {Social_Movement, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of conflict_Perspective_ID000001: 
The conflict perspective is a major sociological approach that assumes that social behaviour is best understood in terms of conflict or tension between competing groups over scarce resources. Unlike the functionalist perspective, which emphasises social harmony and stability, the conflict perspective highlights power struggles, inequality, and social change as inherent features of society. Key theorists associated with the conflict perspective include Karl Marx, who focused on class conflict, and Max Weber, who considered conflict arising from differences in class, status, and power. Contemporary conflict theorists examine various sources of social conflict, including those based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, and other forms of social inequality. This perspective views social institutions and social order as often reflecting the interests of the dominant groups in society.

Causal relation: {Negotiation, Conflict_Perspective} → coordinates → {Social_Movement, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of social_Movement_ID000007: 
A social movement encompasses collective attempts by a group of people to further a common interest or secure a shared goal through organised action that typically takes place outside the sphere of established political institutions and conventional channels. These movements often arise in response to perceived social, economic, or political grievances and seek to bring about or resist social change, existing in a dynamic relationship, often one of conflict, with organisations or power structures whose objectives and outlook they frequently oppose. Social movements can vary widely in their goals, tactics, organisational structures, and the scale of change they aim to achieve, ranging from advocating for specific policy reforms to seeking fundamental transformations in societal norms and values. While they operate outside of formal political systems, successful social movements can sometimes influence policy and, if they manage to gain significant power and become institutionalised, may evolve into formal organisations or even political parties.

Causal relation: {Negotiation, Conflict_Perspective} → coordinates → {Social_Movement, Social_Cohesion}

Semantical explanation of social_Cohesion_ID000005: 
Social Cohesion refers to the degree of solidarity, unity, and sense of belonging that exists among individuals and groups within a society, reflecting the bonds that tie people together and enable them to live and work together effectively. It is characterised by shared values, common norms, mutual trust, and a willingness to cooperate for the collective good. Ã‰mile Durkheim identified two types of social cohesion: mechanical solidarity, found in traditional societies based on homogeneity and shared morality, and organic solidarity, prevalent in modern, complex societies based on interdependence and specialisation. High levels of social cohesion contribute to social stability, order, and collective well-being, fostering a sense of community and mutual support. Conversely, a lack of social cohesion can lead to social disorganisation, conflict, and a sense of anomie or normlessness among individuals.

Causal relation: {Upper_Class, Bourgeoisie} → excludes → {Underclass, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of upper_Class_ID000001: 
The upper class is a social class broadly composed of the most affluent members of society, who typically possess significant wealth, often inherited across generations, and may own large businesses or hold substantial numbers of stocks and shares, wielding considerable economic and social influence. Membership in the upper class is often associated with high social status, exclusive social networks, and a lifestyle characterised by luxury and privilege. While income can be a factor, upper-class status is often more closely tied to the ownership of assets and the perpetuation of wealth over time, distinguishing it from other affluent individuals who may have high incomes but less accumulated wealth or inherited privilege. This class often plays a significant role in shaping economic and political landscapes due to its control over resources and its influence within elite circles.

Semantical explanation of bourgeoisie_ID000007: 
Bourgeoisie, in the theory of Karl Marx, refers to the capitalist class, comprising the owners of the means of production, such as factories, land, and capital. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie stands in opposition to the proletariat, or working class, who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie in order to survive.[1, 2] According to Marx, the bourgeoisie's primary goal is the accumulation of capital and profit, which they achieve through the exploitation of the proletariat. This class structure and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are central to Marx's critique of capitalism.

Causal relation: {Upper_Class, Bourgeoisie} → excludes → {Underclass, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of underclass_ID000002: 
The underclass is a term used in sociology to describe a group of people who are considered to be 'under' or outside the traditional class structure of society, often characterised by chronic poverty, long-term unemployment or underemployment, social isolation, and economic, political, and social marginalisation and exclusion. Members of the underclass may experience multiple and overlapping forms of disadvantage, including limited access to education, healthcare, stable housing, and social support networks, often leading to a cycle of poverty that is difficult to escape. The concept of the underclass is often associated with inner-city areas and may be linked to factors such as deindustrialisation, lack of job opportunities, and systemic discrimination. There is ongoing debate among sociologists about the definition, causes, and consequences of the underclass, as well as the most effective ways to address the complex issues of poverty and social exclusion that affect this group.

Causal relation: {Upper_Class, Bourgeoisie} → excludes → {Underclass, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of minority_Group_ID000005: 
A minority group is a group of people in a minority in a given society who, because of their distinct physical or cultural characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability, find themselves in situations of inequality or disadvantage within that society. Membership in a minority group is typically ascribed rather than achieved, and these groups often experience discrimination, prejudice, and limited access to power and resources compared to the dominant or majority group. The term "minority" in this sociological context does not necessarily refer to a group's numerical size but rather to its subordinate status and lack of social, economic, and political power. Minority groups often develop a strong sense of group solidarity and shared identity in response to their experiences of marginalisation.

Semantical explanation of social_Institutions_ID000002: 
Social Institutions represent complex, enduring, and organised sets of norms, values, statuses, roles, and groups that are established and accepted as fundamental components of a society's structure, primarily organised to meet basic human needs and perform essential societal functions. These major spheres of social life, such as the family, education, religion, government, and the economy, provide a framework for social interaction, guide individual and group behaviour, and contribute to the overall stability and continuity of society. Each institution has its own specific purposes, functions, and established ways of operating, and they are interconnected, influencing and being influenced by one another. Sociologists study social institutions to understand how they are structured, how they function, and how they evolve over time, as well as their impact on individuals and the perpetuation of social inequalities within a society.

Causal relation: {Social_Institutions, Formal_Organisation} → institutionalises → {Social_Structure, Organisation}

Semantical explanation of formal_Organisation_ID000006: 
A formal organisation is a special-purpose group designed and structured for maximum efficiency in achieving specific goals or objectives. These organisations are characterised by a hierarchical structure of authority, a clear division of labor based on specialised roles and responsibilities, formal rules and procedures governing operations, and impersonal relationships among members. Examples of formal organisations include corporations, government agencies, universities, and hospitals. Max Weber's concept of bureaucracy is a classic example of a formal organisation designed for rational and efficient goal attainment. The formal structure of these organisations aims to ensure coordination, accountability, and predictability in their operations, although it can sometimes lead to rigidity and a lack of flexibility.

Causal relation: {Social_Institutions, Formal_Organisation} → institutionalises → {Social_Structure, Organisation}

Semantical explanation of social_Structure_ID000004: 
Social structure refers to the underlying patterns of social relationships, institutions, and social organisation that shape and constrain individuals' behaviour and interactions within a society, providing a framework for social life. It is the way in which a society is organised into predictable relationships and hierarchies based on factors such as social class, gender, race, ethnicity, age, and social institutions like the family, education, government, and the economy. Social structure is not always immediately visible but exerts a powerful influence on individuals' opportunities, experiences, and life chances. Sociologists study social structure to understand the enduring patterns of social behaviour and the ways in which society is organised at a macro level.

Causal relation: {Social_Institutions, Formal_Organisation} → institutionalises → {Social_Structure, Organisation}

Semantical explanation of organisation_ID000004: 
An organisation in sociology refers to a large group of individuals who are structured and coordinated to achieve specific goals or purposes, involving a definite set of authority relations, rules, and procedures that govern their activities. Organisations can range from formal entities like corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions to more informal groups with shared objectives. They are characterised by a division of labor, a hierarchy of authority, and established patterns of communication and interaction among their members. Sociologists study organisations to understand their structure, culture, dynamics, and their role in shaping social life and achieving collective goals.

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000013: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Causal relation: {Deviance, Stigma} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of deviance_ID000009: 
Deviance refers to behaviour that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society. What is considered deviant varies across cultures, social groups, and time periods, as it is defined by social norms and values. Deviant behaviour can range from minor infractions of social norms to serious violations of laws. Sociologists study deviance to understand why people violate norms, how societies react to deviance, and the role of deviance in social change. Various theories attempt to explain deviance, including anomie theory, differential association theory, control theory, and labeling theory. Deviance is not inherently negative; while some deviant acts are harmful, others can challenge existing norms and lead to social progress.

Causal relation: {Deviance, Stigma} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of stigma_ID000002: 
Stigma refers to a negative label, mark of disgrace, or social disapproval that is used to devalue members of deviant social groups or individuals who possess certain characteristics or attributes that are seen as undesirable or different from the prevailing social norms. A stigma can be attached to various conditions, behaviours, or identities, such as mental illness, criminal history, physical disabilities, certain lifestyles, or membership in particular social groups. The process of stigmatisation can lead to social exclusion, discrimination, prejudice, and a loss of social status for the stigmatised individuals or groups, often impacting their self-esteem, social interactions, and opportunities in life. Labeling theory in sociology highlights the role of stigma in the social construction of deviance and its consequences for those who are labeled.

Causal relation: {Deviance, Stigma} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of social_Exclusion_ID000005: 
Social exclusion is a complex and multidimensional process and outcome where individuals or groups are prevented from fully participating in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of the society in which they are located due to a combination of multiple and often intersecting deprivations. These deprivations can include lack of adequate income and resources, limited access to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and social support networks, as well as experiences of discrimination, marginalisation, and a lack of voice or power in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Social exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and a diminished sense of belonging, hindering individuals' ability to exercise their rights, fulfill their potential, and participate as full and valued members of society. Addressing social exclusion requires tackling the various interconnected factors that contribute to it through inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and social integration for all members of society.

Causal relation: {Deviance, Stigma} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion, Minority_Group}

Semantical explanation of minority_Group_ID000006: 
A minority group is a group of people in a minority in a given society who, because of their distinct physical or cultural characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability, find themselves in situations of inequality or disadvantage within that society. Membership in a minority group is typically ascribed rather than achieved, and these groups often experience discrimination, prejudice, and limited access to power and resources compared to the dominant or majority group. The term "minority" in this sociological context does not necessarily refer to a group's numerical size but rather to its subordinate status and lack of social, economic, and political power. Minority groups often develop a strong sense of group solidarity and shared identity in response to their experiences of marginalisation.

Causal relation: {Neoliberalism, Structural_Functionalism} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion, Relative_Deprivation}

Semantical explanation of neoliberalism_ID000002: 
Neoliberalism is a dominant economic belief system and political ideology that advocates for free market forces as the primary route to economic growth and prosperity, achieved by minimizing government restrictions and interventions on business and the economy. Key tenets of neoliberalism include deregulation, privatisation of state-owned enterprises, reduced government spending on social programs, free trade, and fiscal austerity. This ideology gained prominence in the late 20th century and has influenced economic policies in many countries around the world, often leading to increased globalisation and a greater role for the private sector in the economy. While proponents argue that neoliberal policies promote efficiency, innovation, and economic growth, critics point to potential negative consequences such as increased income inequality, social instability, and environmental degradation due to the prioritisation of market forces over social and environmental concerns.

Causal relation: {Neoliberalism, Structural_Functionalism} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion, Relative_Deprivation}

Semantical explanation of structural_Functionalism_ID000001: 
Structural functionalism is a major theoretical perspective in sociology that is rooted in the work of Ã‰mile Durkheim and further developed by Talcott Parsons and Robert Merton. This perspective analyses societies as complex social systems composed of various interconnected social institutions (such as the family, education, religion, government, and the economy), each of which performs specific functions that contribute to the overall stability, order, and smooth operation of the system as a whole. Structural functionalists examine how these institutions work together to meet the needs of society and maintain social equilibrium through shared norms, values, and consensus. They often focus on the functions (both manifest and latent) of social structures and how they contribute to social cohesion and the maintenance of social order.

Causal relation: {Neoliberalism, Structural_Functionalism} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion, Relative_Deprivation}

Semantical explanation of social_Exclusion_ID000006: 
Social exclusion is a complex and multidimensional process and outcome where individuals or groups are prevented from fully participating in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of the society in which they are located due to a combination of multiple and often intersecting deprivations. These deprivations can include lack of adequate income and resources, limited access to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and social support networks, as well as experiences of discrimination, marginalisation, and a lack of voice or power in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Social exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and a diminished sense of belonging, hindering individuals' ability to exercise their rights, fulfill their potential, and participate as full and valued members of society. Addressing social exclusion requires tackling the various interconnected factors that contribute to it through inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and social integration for all members of society.

Causal relation: {Neoliberalism, Structural_Functionalism} → marginalises → {Social_Exclusion, Relative_Deprivation}

Semantical explanation of relative_Deprivation_ID000002: 
Relative deprivation is the thesis that people's subjective feelings of deprivation, discontent, or grievance are not absolute or based on an objective standard of poverty or need, but rather are relative to their assessment of themselves and their situation in comparison with others around them, particularly those they perceive as being more privileged or having more of what they desire. This feeling of being disadvantaged can arise even when one's basic needs are met, if one believes they are unfairly lacking in comparison to a relevant reference group or societal standards. The experience of relative deprivation can be a significant factor in social unrest, the formation of social movements, and the expression of social discontent, as people strive to achieve what they perceive as equitable or just in relation to others.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Network} → influencesHistorically → {Identity, Social_Network}

Semantical explanation of mass_Media_ID000011: 
Mass media refers to forms of communication, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television, films, and the internet, that are designed to reach and influence very large audiences, often simultaneously. These media play a significant role in shaping public opinion, disseminating information, transmitting cultural values and norms, and providing entertainment. The development and widespread availability of mass media have had a profound impact on society, influencing everything from political campaigns and consumer behaviour to popular culture and social movements. Sociologists study mass media to understand its effects on individuals and society, including issues related to media ownership, content, audience reception, and the role of media in shaping social identities and perceptions of reality. The rise of digital and social media has further transformed the landscape of mass communication, creating new opportunities and challenges for how information is produced, distributed, and consumed.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Network} → influencesHistorically → {Identity, Social_Network}

Semantical explanation of network_ID000001: 
A network in sociology refers to a set of informal and formal social ties that connects individuals, groups, or organisations to each other, forming a web of relationships through which information, resources, and social support can flow. These networks can vary in size, density, and complexity, ranging from small, close-knit groups to large, loosely connected global networks facilitated by technology. Social networks play a crucial role in various aspects of social life, influencing everything from job opportunities and social mobility to the spread of ideas and social support systems. The strength and nature of these ties (e.g., strong vs. weak ties) can have different implications for the individuals involved and the functioning of the network as a whole. Sociologists study social networks to understand social capital, social influence, and the structure of social relationships at different levels of analysis.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Network} → influencesHistorically → {Identity, Social_Network}

Semantical explanation of identity_ID000008: 
Identity refers to the distinctive characteristics of a person's character or the character of a group which relate to who they are and what is meaningful to them, providing a sense of self and belonging. Some of the main sources of identity include gender, encompassing social expectations of masculinity and femininity; sexual orientation, referring to patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction; nationality or ethnicity, based on shared cultural heritage, origin, and often language or religion; and social class, reflecting one's position in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Identity is not fixed but is fluid and can evolve over an individual's life course through interactions with others and within different social contexts. It shapes how individuals perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others, influencing their social interactions, opportunities, and experiences within society.

Causal relation: {Mass_Media, Network} → influencesHistorically → {Identity, Social_Network}

Semantical explanation of social_Network_ID000004: 
A social network refers to a series of interconnected social relationships that links an individual directly to other people and, through them, indirectly to an even wider circle of individuals, forming a complex web of social connections. These networks can be based on various types of relationships, including friendship, kinship, work affiliations, shared interests, or online interactions, and they facilitate the flow of information, resources, social support, and influence among the individuals within them. The structure and characteristics of an individual's social network, such as its size, density, and the strength of its ties, can have significant implications for their opportunities, well-being, and social capital, which is the collective benefit derived from social connections and relationships.

Semantical explanation of social_Movement_ID000008: 
A social movement encompasses collective attempts by a group of people to further a common interest or secure a shared goal through organised action that typically takes place outside the sphere of established political institutions and conventional channels. These movements often arise in response to perceived social, economic, or political grievances and seek to bring about or resist social change, existing in a dynamic relationship, often one of conflict, with organisations or power structures whose objectives and outlook they frequently oppose. Social movements can vary widely in their goals, tactics, organisational structures, and the scale of change they aim to achieve, ranging from advocating for specific policy reforms to seeking fundamental transformations in societal norms and values. While they operate outside of formal political systems, successful social movements can sometimes influence policy and, if they manage to gain significant power and become institutionalised, may evolve into formal organisations or even political parties.

Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

A social movement encompasses collective attempts by a group of people to further a common interest or secure a shared goal through organised action that typically takes place outside the sphere of established political institutions and conventional channels. These movements often arise in response to perceived social, economic, or political grievances and seek to bring about or resist social change, existing in a dynamic relationship, often one of conflict, with organisations or power structures whose objectives and outlook they frequently oppose. Social movements can vary widely in their goals, tactics, organisational structures, and the scale of change they aim to achieve, ranging from advocating for specific policy reforms to seeking fundamental transformations in societal norms and values. While they operate outside of formal political systems, successful social movements can sometimes influence policy and, if they manage to gain significant power and become institutionalised, may evolve into formal organisations or even political parties.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, Resource_Mobilisation} → coordinates → {Coalition, Political_Action_Committee_(PAC)}

Semantical explanation of resource_Mobilisation_ID000006: 
Resource mobilisation theory (RMT) is a major theoretical perspective in the study of social movements that emphasises the crucial role of resourcesâ€”such as money, political influence, access to the media, personnel (volunteers and staff), and communication networksâ€”in the emergence, growth, and success of social movements. RMT argues that grievances or social discontent are widespread and are not sufficient on their own to explain the development of social movements; rather, it is the ability of aggrieved groups to mobilise and effectively utilise various types of resources that determines whether a social movement will form and achieve its goals. This theory focuses on the strategic actions of social movement organisations in acquiring, organizing, and deploying resources to challenge existing power structures and bring about social change.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, Resource_Mobilisation} → coordinates → {Coalition, Political_Action_Committee_(PAC)}

Semantical explanation of coalition_ID000002: 
A coalition is a temporary or permanent alliance geared toward a common goal, often formed by individuals or groups who may have different interests or goals in other areas but come together to achieve a specific shared objective. Coalitions can be found in various social contexts, including politics, business, and social movements. They are often formed to increase the collective power and influence of the participating members in order to achieve a goal that might be difficult or impossible to achieve individually. The stability and effectiveness of a coalition can depend on factors such as the clarity of the common goal, the commitment of the members, and the distribution of power within the alliance. Coalitions can be fluid and may dissolve once the shared goal is achieved or if internal conflicts arise.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, Resource_Mobilisation} → coordinates → {Coalition, Political_Action_Committee_(PAC)}

Semantical explanation of political_Action_Committee_(PAC)_ID000005: 
A political action committee (PAC) is a political committee that is typically established by an interest groupâ€”such as a national bank, corporation, trade association, cooperative, or membership associationâ€”for the specific purpose of soliciting and distributing financial contributions to candidates running for political office or to political parties. PACs are a significant part of the campaign finance system in many democracies, allowing organised groups to pool resources and support candidates who align with their interests and policy objectives. The regulations governing PACs, including the amount of money they can raise and contribute, vary depending on the jurisdiction.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, New_Social_Movements} → hasInfluence → {Political_System, Democracy}

Semantical explanation of new_Social_Movements_ID000001: 
New social movements (NSMs) are organised collective activities that promote autonomy, self-determination, and improvements in the quality of life, often focusing on issues beyond traditional class-based or economic concerns. These movements typically emerge in post-industrial societies and address issues such as environmental protection, human rights, peace, gender equality, and social justice, often mobilizing through grassroots activism, non-hierarchical structures, and the use of media and technology to raise awareness and advocate for change. NSMs often emphasise identity, culture, and the transformation of values and social norms, rather than solely seeking political power or economic redistribution. They represent a shift in the focus of social movements towards broader social and cultural issues and often involve diverse participants united by shared values and concerns about the direction of modern society.

Semantical explanation of political_System_ID000007: 
A political system is the social institution within a society that relies on a recognised set of procedures and structures for implementing and achieving the collective goals of a group or society, particularly those related to power, authority, and governance. It encompasses the government, political parties, interest groups, and the broader political culture, including the norms, values, and beliefs that shape political behaviour and decision-making processes. The political system is responsible for making and enforcing rules, resolving conflicts, and allocating resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, New_Social_Movements} → hasInfluence → {Political_System, Democracy}

Semantical explanation of democracy_ID000007: 
Democracy is a political system in which power is exercised by the people as a whole, either directly or through elected representatives. Key principles of democracy typically include free and fair elections, the rule of law, protection of individual rights and freedoms (such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press), and the accountability of government to the people. Democratic systems can take various forms, such as parliamentary democracies, presidential democracies, and direct democracies, each with its own specific structures and processes for decision-making and governance. The concept of democracy is often associated with values such as equality, participation, and the consent of the governed. The spread and consolidation of democracy have been major themes in political sociology, with researchers studying the factors that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of democratic institutions around the world.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, Collective_Behaviour} → mobilises → {Politics, Social_Change}

Semantical explanation of collective_Behaviour_ID000006: 
Collective behaviour encompasses activities of people and social groups that typically emerge spontaneously (such as crowds, riots, and so on) rather than arising from established processes of socialisation leading to conformity to social rules and norms. These behaviours often occur in response to a shared situation or stimulus and can involve large numbers of people acting in relatively unstructured ways. Examples of collective behaviour include panics, fads, rumors, social movements, and disasters. Sociologists study collective behaviour to understand the dynamics of group actions that are not governed by typical social structures or institutions. Factors such as anonymity, suggestibility, and the rapid spread of information can play a significant role in shaping collective behaviour.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, Collective_Behaviour} → mobilises → {Politics, Social_Change}

Semantical explanation of politics_ID000009: 
Politics, in Harold D. Lasswell's classic definition, is fundamentally about "who gets what, when, and how," highlighting the struggle for power and resources within a society and the processes through which decisions are made about their distribution and allocation. It involves the exercise of power and influence to shape policies, make collective decisions, and resolve conflicts over competing interests and values. Politics operates at various levels, from interpersonal relationships and small groups to national and international arenas, and is a central aspect of social organisation and governance.

Semantical explanation of social_Change_ID000011: 
Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, Resource_Mobilisation} → protests → {Political_System, Government}

Semantical explanation of social_Movement_ID000012: 
A social movement encompasses collective attempts by a group of people to further a common interest or secure a shared goal through organised action that typically takes place outside the sphere of established political institutions and conventional channels. These movements often arise in response to perceived social, economic, or political grievances and seek to bring about or resist social change, existing in a dynamic relationship, often one of conflict, with organisations or power structures whose objectives and outlook they frequently oppose. Social movements can vary widely in their goals, tactics, organisational structures, and the scale of change they aim to achieve, ranging from advocating for specific policy reforms to seeking fundamental transformations in societal norms and values. While they operate outside of formal political systems, successful social movements can sometimes influence policy and, if they manage to gain significant power and become institutionalised, may evolve into formal organisations or even political parties.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, Resource_Mobilisation} → protests → {Political_System, Government}

Semantical explanation of resource_Mobilisation_ID000007: 
Resource mobilisation theory (RMT) is a major theoretical perspective in the study of social movements that emphasises the crucial role of resourcesâ€”such as money, political influence, access to the media, personnel (volunteers and staff), and communication networksâ€”in the emergence, growth, and success of social movements. RMT argues that grievances or social discontent are widespread and are not sufficient on their own to explain the development of social movements; rather, it is the ability of aggrieved groups to mobilise and effectively utilise various types of resources that determines whether a social movement will form and achieve its goals. This theory focuses on the strategic actions of social movement organisations in acquiring, organizing, and deploying resources to challenge existing power structures and bring about social change.

Semantical explanation of political_System_ID000008: 
A political system is the social institution within a society that relies on a recognised set of procedures and structures for implementing and achieving the collective goals of a group or society, particularly those related to power, authority, and governance. It encompasses the government, political parties, interest groups, and the broader political culture, including the norms, values, and beliefs that shape political behaviour and decision-making processes. The political system is responsible for making and enforcing rules, resolving conflicts, and allocating resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Social_Movement, Resource_Mobilisation} → protests → {Political_System, Government}

Semantical explanation of government_ID000004: 
Government refers to the regular enactment of policies, decisions, and matters of state by officials within a political apparatus, representing the formal organisation that has the authority to make and enforce laws and regulations within a specific territory or society. It encompasses the various institutions and processes through which a state exercises its power and authority, including legislative bodies that create laws, executive branches that implement and enforce them, and judicial systems that interpret laws and resolve disputes. Governments play a crucial role in maintaining social order, providing public services, regulating the economy, and representing the interests of the state in its interactions with other nations. The form and structure of government can vary widely, ranging from democracies to authoritarian regimes, each with different mechanisms for the selection of officials and the exercise of power. Political sociology examines the role of government in society, its relationship with citizens and other social institutions, and the factors that influence its policies and actions.

Semantical explanation of social_Network_ID000005: 
A social network refers to a series of interconnected social relationships that links an individual directly to other people and, through them, indirectly to an even wider circle of individuals, forming a complex web of social connections. These networks can be based on various types of relationships, including friendship, kinship, work affiliations, shared interests, or online interactions, and they facilitate the flow of information, resources, social support, and influence among the individuals within them. The structure and characteristics of an individual's social network, such as its size, density, and the strength of its ties, can have significant implications for their opportunities, well-being, and social capital, which is the collective benefit derived from social connections and relationships.

Semantical explanation of internet_ID000008: 
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that allows people to communicate with one another and find information on the Worldwide Web by exchanging data in various forms, including visuals, sounds, and text. This vast network operates in a way that largely transcends the limitations of time, physical space, and the traditional costs and control mechanisms associated with distance and territorial governments. The Internet has become an indispensable tool for communication, education, commerce, entertainment, and social interaction, connecting billions of people around the world and providing access to an unprecedented amount of information and resources. Its decentralised nature and open architecture have fostered innovation and the rapid development of new technologies and applications, transforming many aspects of modern life and contributing to the phenomenon of globalisation.

Causal relation: {Social_Network, Internet} → networks → {Social_Interaction, Peer_Group}

Semantical explanation of social_Interaction_ID000003: 
Social interaction is the fundamental process by which people act and react in relation to others, involving communication, mutual influence, and the creation of shared meanings and social bonds. It occurs at all levels of social life, from brief encounters between strangers to long-term relationships within families and close-knit groups, and in formal settings like workplaces and organisations as well as informal settings like social gatherings. Social interaction can take various forms, including verbal communication, nonverbal cues such as gestures and facial expressions, and the exchange of symbols and meanings. It is through social interaction that individuals develop their sense of self, learn social norms, establish relationships, and collectively construct social reality. The study of social interaction is a core focus of microsociology, aiming to understand the patterns and dynamics of everyday social life.

Causal relation: {Social_Network, Internet} → networks → {Social_Interaction, Peer_Group}

Semantical explanation of peer_Group_ID000004: 
A peer group is a social group whose members share common characteristics such as similar interests, social position, age, and often a sense of shared identity and belonging. Peer groups play a significant role in the socialisation process, particularly during adolescence, influencing individuals' attitudes, values, behaviours, and self-concept. They provide a context for learning social skills, developing relationships, and establishing norms and expectations that may differ from those of the family or broader society. Peer influence can be strong, shaping choices related to fashion, music, activities, and even academic performance. Peer groups can provide social support and a sense of community, but they can also exert pressure to conform to group norms, sometimes in ways that may be positive or negative for the individual.

Causal relation: {Social_Network, Network} → mobilises → {Collective_Behaviour, Social_Movement}

Semantical explanation of network_ID000002: 
A network in sociology refers to a set of informal and formal social ties that connects individuals, groups, or organisations to each other, forming a web of relationships through which information, resources, and social support can flow. These networks can vary in size, density, and complexity, ranging from small, close-knit groups to large, loosely connected global networks facilitated by technology. Social networks play a crucial role in various aspects of social life, influencing everything from job opportunities and social mobility to the spread of ideas and social support systems. The strength and nature of these ties (e.g., strong vs. weak ties) can have different implications for the individuals involved and the functioning of the network as a whole. Sociologists study social networks to understand social capital, social influence, and the structure of social relationships at different levels of analysis.

Causal relation: {Social_Network, Network} → mobilises → {Collective_Behaviour, Social_Movement}

Semantical explanation of collective_Behaviour_ID000007: 
Collective behaviour encompasses activities of people and social groups that typically emerge spontaneously (such as crowds, riots, and so on) rather than arising from established processes of socialisation leading to conformity to social rules and norms. These behaviours often occur in response to a shared situation or stimulus and can involve large numbers of people acting in relatively unstructured ways. Examples of collective behaviour include panics, fads, rumors, social movements, and disasters. Sociologists study collective behaviour to understand the dynamics of group actions that are not governed by typical social structures or institutions. Factors such as anonymity, suggestibility, and the rapid spread of information can play a significant role in shaping collective behaviour.

Causal relation: {Social_Network, Network} → mobilises → {Collective_Behaviour, Social_Movement}

Semantical explanation of social_Movement_ID000013: 
A social movement encompasses collective attempts by a group of people to further a common interest or secure a shared goal through organised action that typically takes place outside the sphere of established political institutions and conventional channels. These movements often arise in response to perceived social, economic, or political grievances and seek to bring about or resist social change, existing in a dynamic relationship, often one of conflict, with organisations or power structures whose objectives and outlook they frequently oppose. Social movements can vary widely in their goals, tactics, organisational structures, and the scale of change they aim to achieve, ranging from advocating for specific policy reforms to seeking fundamental transformations in societal norms and values. While they operate outside of formal political systems, successful social movements can sometimes influence policy and, if they manage to gain significant power and become institutionalised, may evolve into formal organisations or even political parties.

Causal relation: {Social_Network} → mobilises → {Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of social_Network_ID000007: 
A social network refers to a series of interconnected social relationships that links an individual directly to other people and, through them, indirectly to an even wider circle of individuals, forming a complex web of social connections. These networks can be based on various types of relationships, including friendship, kinship, work affiliations, shared interests, or online interactions, and they facilitate the flow of information, resources, social support, and influence among the individuals within them. The structure and characteristics of an individual's social network, such as its size, density, and the strength of its ties, can have significant implications for their opportunities, well-being, and social capital, which is the collective benefit derived from social connections and relationships.

Causal relation: {Social_Network} → mobilises → {Collective_Behaviour}

Semantical explanation of collective_Behaviour_ID000008: 
Collective behaviour encompasses activities of people and social groups that typically emerge spontaneously (such as crowds, riots, and so on) rather than arising from established processes of socialisation leading to conformity to social rules and norms. These behaviours often occur in response to a shared situation or stimulus and can involve large numbers of people acting in relatively unstructured ways. Examples of collective behaviour include panics, fads, rumors, social movements, and disasters. Sociologists study collective behaviour to understand the dynamics of group actions that are not governed by typical social structures or institutions. Factors such as anonymity, suggestibility, and the rapid spread of information can play a significant role in shaping collective behaviour.

Causal relation: {Social_Control, Norms} → regulates → {Deviance, Formal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000014: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Causal relation: {Social_Control, Norms} → regulates → {Deviance, Formal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of norms_ID000002: 
Norms are the rules, standards, and expectations of behaviour that are widely shared and understood within a society or group, guiding the actions and interactions of its members and defining what is considered acceptable, appropriate, and desirable in various social situations. Norms can be formal, such as laws and written rules with specific sanctions for violations, or informal, such as customs, traditions, and social etiquette that are maintained through social approval or disapproval. They provide a framework for social order and cohesion, helping individuals to anticipate how others will behave and to know how they themselves are expected to act. Norms vary across cultures and can change over time within a society, reflecting evolving values and beliefs.

Causal relation: {Social_Control, Norms} → regulates → {Deviance, Formal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of deviance_ID000010: 
Deviance refers to behaviour that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society. What is considered deviant varies across cultures, social groups, and time periods, as it is defined by social norms and values. Deviant behaviour can range from minor infractions of social norms to serious violations of laws. Sociologists study deviance to understand why people violate norms, how societies react to deviance, and the role of deviance in social change. Various theories attempt to explain deviance, including anomie theory, differential association theory, control theory, and labeling theory. Deviance is not inherently negative; while some deviant acts are harmful, others can challenge existing norms and lead to social progress.

Causal relation: {Social_Control, Norms} → regulates → {Deviance, Formal_Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of formal_Social_Control_ID000006: 
Formal social control refers to the mechanisms and processes used by authorised agents and institutions within society to maintain order, enforce laws, and ensure conformity to established norms and rules. These agents include police officers, judges, school administrators, employers, and other individuals who have been given the authority to enforce social norms and impose sanctions when violations occur. Formal social control is characterised by its reliance on written rules, laws, and regulations, as well as established procedures for identifying and punishing deviant behaviour. Examples of formal social control mechanisms include arrests, prosecutions, disciplinary actions, and legal penalties. It plays a crucial role in maintaining social stability and protecting societal values and interests, often working in conjunction with informal social control mechanisms, such as social disapproval and peer pressure.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Reproduction, Education} → reproduces → {Social_Class, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Reproduction_ID000004: 
Cultural reproduction refers to the process by which a society transmits dominant knowledge, values, beliefs, and social inequalities from one generation to another. This transmission occurs through various social institutions, including the family, education system, media, and religion. Cultural reproduction theory, particularly associated with the work of Pierre Bourdieu and Basil Bernstein, highlights how the dominant culture in a society tends to be perpetuated, often reinforcing existing power structures and social hierarchies. For example, the education system may prioritise certain forms of knowledge and cultural capital that are more readily accessible to children from privileged backgrounds, thereby contributing to their continued success and the reproduction of social class differences across generations. Similarly, the media can play a role in shaping and reinforcing dominant ideologies and cultural norms. Understanding cultural reproduction helps sociologists analyse how social inequalities are maintained and transmitted over time, even in the absence of overt discrimination.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Reproduction, Education} → reproduces → {Social_Class, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of education_ID000015: 
Education is a formal process of learning in which some people consciously teach while others adopt the social role of learner, typically occurring in institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. However, education also encompasses informal learning that takes place outside of formal settings, such as through family, peers, and media. The goals of education are multifaceted, including the transmission of knowledge, skills, values, and cultural norms from one generation to the next, as well as the personal and intellectual development of individuals. Education plays a crucial role in socialisation, preparing individuals for their roles in society and contributing to social mobility. Sociologists study education to understand its impact on social inequality, its relationship to the economy, and its role in shaping individual identities and life chances.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Reproduction, Education} → reproduces → {Social_Class, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000009: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Cultural_Reproduction, Education} → reproduces → {Social_Class, Cultural_Capital}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Capital_ID000008: 
Cultural capital, a concept developed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, refers to the types of knowledge, skills, education, and other cultural resources that confer advantages on those who acquire them, providing them with social mobility and status within a society. Bourdieu identified three forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalised. Embodied cultural capital exists in the form of knowledge and skills that are consciously acquired and passively inherited, such as language proficiency, manners, tastes, and dispositions. These are often learned through socialisation within a particular social class or cultural environment. Objectified cultural capital refers to cultural goods such as books, artworks, musical instruments, and other material objects that can be owned and transmitted. However, the possession of these objects is not sufficient; one must also have the cultural competence to understand and appreciate them to fully benefit from this form of capital. Institutionalised cultural capital consists of academic credentials, professional qualifications, and other forms of formal recognition that legitimate an individual's cultural competence and confer social advantages in the labor market and other social institutions. Cultural capital plays a significant role in social reproduction, as individuals from privileged backgrounds often possess more cultural capital, which helps them succeed in educational systems and gain access to higher-status occupations, thereby perpetuating social inequalities across generations.

Causal relation: {Survey, Census} → surveys → {Quantitative_Research_Methods, Representative_Sample}

Semantical explanation of survey_ID000002: 
A survey is a widely used method of sociological research that typically involves the systematic administration of a standardised set of questions, often in the form of questionnaires, to a sample of individuals drawn from a larger population being studied. The goal of a survey is to collect data on the attitudes, beliefs, behaviours, opinions, or characteristics of the population of interest through the responses provided by the sample members. The data collected through surveys is often analysed using statistical techniques to identify patterns, regularities, and relationships between variables within the population. Surveys can be conducted in various formats, including mail-in questionnaires, telephone interviews, face-to-face interviews, and online surveys, each with its own advantages and limitations in terms of cost, response rates, and the type of data that can be collected. The quality of a survey depends on factors such as the design of the questions, the selection of a representative sample, and the rate of response from the participants.

Causal relation: {Survey, Census} → surveys → {Quantitative_Research_Methods, Representative_Sample}

Semantical explanation of census_ID000001: 
A census is an enumeration, or counting, of a population, typically conducted by a government at regular intervals. It aims to gather comprehensive demographic, social, and economic data about all individuals residing within a country or region at a specific point in time. The information collected in a census can include age, sex, race, ethnicity, education level, occupation, income, and household characteristics. This data is crucial for various purposes, such as allocating government resources, determining political representation, and informing policy decisions. The methodology of a census can vary, but it often involves distributing questionnaires to households or conducting door-to-door surveys. Ensuring accuracy and completeness in a census can be challenging due to factors like population mobility and reluctance to participate. Modern censuses often utilise technology to improve data collection and processing.

Semantical explanation of quantitative_Research_Methods_ID000002: 
Quantitative research methods are those sociological methods that primarily focus on collecting and analysing social phenomena using numerical data, mathematical models, statistical techniques, and computational methods to measure and quantify social patterns, relationships between variables, and the strength and direction of these relationships. These methods often involve the use of surveys with closed-ended questions, experiments with controlled variables, and the analysis of large datasets to identify trends, test hypotheses, and make generalisations about populations. The goal of quantitative research is often to establish statistical significance, identify causal relationships, and produce findings that can be generalised to a larger population.

Semantical explanation of representative_Sample_ID000002: 
A representative sample is a selection of individuals or cases drawn from a larger population that is statistically found to be typical of that population in terms of key characteristics relevant to the study, such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or opinions. The goal of obtaining a representative sample is to ensure that the findings from the sample can be generalised with a reasonable degree of accuracy to the entire population from which the sample was drawn, allowing researchers to make broader inferences and conclusions about the population as a whole. Various sampling techniques, including random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling, are used to try to achieve a representative sample.

Causal relation: {Operational_Definition, Variable} → measures → {Correlation_Coefficient, Validity}

Semantical explanation of operational_Definition_ID000001: 
An operational definition is a clear, precise, and specific explanation of an abstract concept that is formulated in a way that allows a researcher to measure the concept empirically and systematically. It involves defining the concept in terms of the concrete, observable, and measurable indicators or procedures that will be used to represent it in a research study. For example, if a researcher is studying the concept of "happiness," an operational definition might be the score an individual reports on a standardised happiness scale, or the frequency with which they exhibit positive emotions during an observation period. Providing operational definitions is crucial for ensuring clarity, consistency, and replicability in research, as it specifies exactly how a concept will be measured and allows other researchers to understand and potentially replicate the study.

Causal relation: {Operational_Definition, Variable} → measures → {Correlation_Coefficient, Validity}

Semantical explanation of variable_ID000001: 
A variable is a concept or characteristic whose value or attribute changes or varies from one case to another, or across different individuals, groups, situations, or over time. It is a dimension along which an object, individual, or group can be categorised or measured, allowing for specific comparisons to be made with others or across different points in time. Examples of variables in sociological research include income level (which can vary from person to person), age (which changes over time for an individual), educational attainment (which differs among individuals), or social class (which can vary across groups or societies). Researchers examine the relationships between different variables to understand social phenomena, test hypotheses, and develop sociological theories. Variables can be independent (the presumed cause) or dependent (the presumed effect) in a causal relationship.

Causal relation: {Operational_Definition, Variable} → measures → {Correlation_Coefficient, Validity}

Semantical explanation of correlation_Coefficient_ID000001: 
A correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the degree of correlation between two variables, indicating the strength and direction of their linear relationship. The value of a correlation coefficient typically ranges from -1.0 to +1.0. A coefficient of +1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable increases proportionally. A coefficient of -1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases proportionally. A coefficient of 0 indicates no linear correlation between the two variables. The closer the coefficient is to +1.0 or -1.0, the stronger the correlation; the closer it is to 0, the weaker the correlation. Correlation does not imply causation, meaning that just because two variables are correlated does not necessarily mean that one causes the other.

Causal relation: {Operational_Definition, Variable} → measures → {Correlation_Coefficient, Validity}

Semantical explanation of validity_ID000001: 
Validity in research refers to the extent to which a measurement instrument, test, or research study accurately measures precisely what it is intended to measure, ensuring that the findings genuinely represent the phenomenon or concept being investigated. It addresses the question of whether the research is actually capturing the truth about what is being studied. Different types of validity are important in research, including internal validity (the extent to which the study establishes a trustworthy cause-and-effect relationship between variables), external validity (the extent to which the findings can be generalised to other populations, settings, or times), construct validity (the degree to which a measure assesses the theoretical construct it is supposed to measure), and content validity (the extent to which a measure adequately covers all aspects of the construct of interest). Ensuring validity is crucial for the credibility and meaningfulness of research findings.

Causal relation: {Segregation, Social_Class} → segregates → {Urban_Ecology, Social_Spatial_Regions}

Semantical explanation of segregation_ID000005: 
Segregation refers to the act and process of physically, socially, or legally separating two or more groups of people, often based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or socioeconomic status. While segregation can occur in various forms, it is frequently imposed on a minority group by a dominant group within a society, leading to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social institutions such as housing, education, healthcare, and employment. Segregation can be enforced through explicit laws and policies (de jure segregation) or through informal social norms and practices (de facto segregation). It often results in social isolation, limited intergroup contact, and the perpetuation of inequalities between the separated groups. The history of segregation in various parts of the world, such as racial segregation in the United States and apartheid in South Africa, demonstrates its profound and lasting negative impacts on marginalised groups and society as a whole.

Causal relation: {Segregation, Social_Class} → segregates → {Urban_Ecology, Social_Spatial_Regions}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000010: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Segregation, Social_Class} → segregates → {Urban_Ecology, Social_Spatial_Regions}

Semantical explanation of urban_Ecology_ID000002: 
Urban ecology is a subfield within sociology that focuses on the study of the intricate link and dynamic interrelationships between the physical and social dimensions of cities, examining how the spatial organisation, physical environment, and material infrastructure of urban areas shape social life, human behaviour, and community dynamics, and vice versa. It explores topics such as the distribution of populations, resources, and social problems within urban spaces, the impact of urban design and planning on social interactions, the relationship between urban environments and human health, and the processes of urban growth, change, and sustainability. Drawing on ecological principles, urban ecology views the city as a complex ecosystem where social and physical factors are interdependent and constantly interacting to shape the urban experience.

Semantical explanation of social_Spatial_Regions_ID000001: 
Social_Spatial_Regions encompasses the various spatially defined areas and environments that are socially constructed, organised, and experienced as meaningful contexts for human interaction and social life. This category includes both physical and virtual spaces that have been imbued with social significance and serve as contexts for different forms of social behaviour and interaction. It covers urban formations ranging from historical city types to contemporary metropolitan areas and suburban developments, reflecting the evolution of human settlement patterns and spatial organisation. The category includes specialised spatial concepts such as defended neighborhoods, which represent territorialised social spaces, and squatter settlements, which reflect informal urban development patterns. Virtual spaces are represented through cyberspace, acknowledging the increasing importance of digital environments in contemporary social life. The public sphere represents spaces dedicated to democratic discourse and civic engagement. Back regions refer to spaces where individuals can relax social performances and behave more informally. These spatial regions are not merely physical containers but are actively constructed through social processes, carrying cultural meanings, social rules, and behavioural expectations that shape how individuals and groups interact within them.

Causal relation: {Stigma, Labeling_Theory} → stigmatises → {Identity, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of stigma_ID000003: 
Stigma refers to a negative label, mark of disgrace, or social disapproval that is used to devalue members of deviant social groups or individuals who possess certain characteristics or attributes that are seen as undesirable or different from the prevailing social norms. A stigma can be attached to various conditions, behaviours, or identities, such as mental illness, criminal history, physical disabilities, certain lifestyles, or membership in particular social groups. The process of stigmatisation can lead to social exclusion, discrimination, prejudice, and a loss of social status for the stigmatised individuals or groups, often impacting their self-esteem, social interactions, and opportunities in life. Labeling theory in sociology highlights the role of stigma in the social construction of deviance and its consequences for those who are labeled.

Causal relation: {Stigma, Labeling_Theory} → stigmatises → {Identity, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of labeling_Theory_ID000002: 
Labeling theory is a sociological approach to understanding deviance that attempts to explain why certain people are viewed and treated as deviants while others engaging in the same behaviour are not. This theory emphasises the role of social reaction and the application of labels in the creation of deviance. It suggests that deviance is not inherent in an act itself but rather is a social construct defined by how society responds to certain behaviours and individuals. When individuals are labeled as deviant by political authorities or other influential groups, this label can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to further deviant behaviour as the labeled individuals internalise the label and are treated accordingly by others. Labeling theory highlights the power of social definitions and the consequences of being labeled as deviant for an individual's identity and life chances.

Causal relation: {Stigma, Labeling_Theory} → stigmatises → {Identity, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of identity_ID000009: 
Identity refers to the distinctive characteristics of a person's character or the character of a group which relate to who they are and what is meaningful to them, providing a sense of self and belonging. Some of the main sources of identity include gender, encompassing social expectations of masculinity and femininity; sexual orientation, referring to patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction; nationality or ethnicity, based on shared cultural heritage, origin, and often language or religion; and social class, reflecting one's position in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Identity is not fixed but is fluid and can evolve over an individual's life course through interactions with others and within different social contexts. It shapes how individuals perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others, influencing their social interactions, opportunities, and experiences within society.

Causal relation: {Stigma, Labeling_Theory} → stigmatises → {Identity, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of social_Exclusion_ID000007: 
Social exclusion is a complex and multidimensional process and outcome where individuals or groups are prevented from fully participating in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of the society in which they are located due to a combination of multiple and often intersecting deprivations. These deprivations can include lack of adequate income and resources, limited access to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and social support networks, as well as experiences of discrimination, marginalisation, and a lack of voice or power in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Social exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and a diminished sense of belonging, hindering individuals' ability to exercise their rights, fulfill their potential, and participate as full and valued members of society. Addressing social exclusion requires tackling the various interconnected factors that contribute to it through inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and social integration for all members of society.

Causal relation: {Labeling_Theory, Social_Constructionist_Perspective} → stigmatises → {Stigma, Deviance}

Semantical explanation of social_Constructionist_Perspective_ID000001: 
The social constructionist perspective is a sociological approach to understanding various social phenomena, including deviance, that emphasises the role of culture, social interaction, and shared meanings in the creation and definition of social reality. In the context of deviance, this perspective argues that what is considered deviant is not inherent in a particular behaviour itself but rather is socially defined and labeled as such by particular groups or societies based on cultural norms, values, and power dynamics. The social construction of deviance involves processes through which certain behaviours come to be defined as unacceptable or abnormal, and individuals who engage in these behaviours are labeled as deviant, often with significant social consequences for their identity and life chances. This perspective highlights the relativity of deviance across different cultures and time periods.

Causal relation: {Labeling_Theory, Social_Constructionist_Perspective} → stigmatises → {Stigma, Deviance}

Semantical explanation of deviance_ID000011: 
Deviance refers to behaviour that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society. What is considered deviant varies across cultures, social groups, and time periods, as it is defined by social norms and values. Deviant behaviour can range from minor infractions of social norms to serious violations of laws. Sociologists study deviance to understand why people violate norms, how societies react to deviance, and the role of deviance in social change. Various theories attempt to explain deviance, including anomie theory, differential association theory, control theory, and labeling theory. Deviance is not inherently negative; while some deviant acts are harmful, others can challenge existing norms and lead to social progress.

Semantical explanation of suburb_ID000001: 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a suburb is defined as any territory within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) that is not included in the central city or cities of that MSA. Metropolitan areas are typically defined as having at least one urbanised area of 50,000 or more people, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core urban area, as measured by commuting ties. Suburbs are often characterised by lower population density compared to central cities, a higher proportion of single-family homes, and a greater reliance on automobiles for transportation. They have become a significant form of residential and commercial development in many industrialised countries, often representing a migration of population and economic activity away from the central urban core. The development and characteristics of suburbs are influenced by various factors, including transportation infrastructure, housing policies, economic trends, and social preferences.

A megalopolis is a vast urban region that contains a number of cities and their surrounding suburbs, forming an interconnected network of metropolitan areas that have grown together over time. These regions are characterised by high population density, extensive infrastructure connecting the different urban centers, and significant economic and social integration across the area. Examples of megalopolises include the BosWash corridor in the northeastern United States, which stretches from Boston to Washington, D.C., and the Tokaido corridor in Japan, connecting Tokyo and Osaka. The development of megalopolises reflects the increasing urbanisation and interconnectedness of modern societies, posing unique challenges and opportunities for urban planning, transportation, and regional governance.

Causal relation: {Suburb, Megalopolis} → inhabits → {Defended_Neighborhood, Squatter_Settlements}

Semantical explanation of defended_Neighborhood_ID000002: 
A defended neighborhood is a neighborhood that residents identify through defined community borders and through a perception that adjacent areas are geographically separate and socially different. This concept highlights the social construction of neighborhood boundaries and the sense of territoriality and identity that residents develop in relation to their local area. Residents of a defended neighborhood often feel a strong sense of belonging and may actively work to maintain the perceived social and physical boundaries of their community, sometimes in response to perceived threats or differences from neighboring areas. This can involve social activities, community organisations, and even informal surveillance to reinforce the neighborhood's identity and distinctiveness. The concept of a defended neighborhood is relevant to understanding urban sociology, community studies, and issues related to social cohesion and inter-neighborhood relations. The perceived differences between a defended neighborhood and adjacent areas can be based on factors such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, lifestyle, or levels of crime.

Causal relation: {Suburb, Megalopolis} → inhabits → {Defended_Neighborhood, Squatter_Settlements}

Semantical explanation of squatter_Settlements_ID000001: 
Squatter settlements are informal and often unplanned areas of housing that are typically occupied by the very poor on the fringes of cities or in other marginal urban spaces, where residents do not have legal rights to the land they occupy or the dwellings they construct. Housing in squatter settlements is often self-built by the settlers themselves using whatever discarded or inexpensive materials they can find, resulting in makeshift structures that may lack basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, electricity, and secure tenure. These settlements often emerge due to rapid urbanisation, poverty, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate urban planning, and they can face challenges related to overcrowding, health risks, and the threat of eviction. Sociologists study squatter settlements to understand the living conditions, social organisation, and the struggles for recognition and basic rights faced by their residents, as well as the broader issues of urban poverty and inequality.

Causal relation: {State, Government} → regulates → {Social_Control, Law}

Semantical explanation of state_ID000002: 
The state in sociology refers to a political apparatus or organised structure of rule that governs a specific territory and its population, characterised by its authority, which is generally backed by law, and its capacity to use force to maintain order and enforce its policies. It typically includes governmental institutions such as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as the civil service officials who administer state functions. A key feature of the state is its claim to sovereignty over the territory and its citizens, meaning it asserts the ultimate authority within its borders, often recognised by other states in the international system. The state plays a crucial role in establishing and enforcing laws, providing public services, regulating the economy, and defending its territory and interests, often relying on a monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within its boundaries to ensure compliance and maintain social order.

Causal relation: {State, Government} → regulates → {Social_Control, Law}

Semantical explanation of government_ID000005: 
Government refers to the regular enactment of policies, decisions, and matters of state by officials within a political apparatus, representing the formal organisation that has the authority to make and enforce laws and regulations within a specific territory or society. It encompasses the various institutions and processes through which a state exercises its power and authority, including legislative bodies that create laws, executive branches that implement and enforce them, and judicial systems that interpret laws and resolve disputes. Governments play a crucial role in maintaining social order, providing public services, regulating the economy, and representing the interests of the state in its interactions with other nations. The form and structure of government can vary widely, ranging from democracies to authoritarian regimes, each with different mechanisms for the selection of officials and the exercise of power. Political sociology examines the role of government in society, its relationship with citizens and other social institutions, and the factors that influence its policies and actions.

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000015: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Semantical explanation of law_ID000009: 
Law refers to governmental social control, representing a formal system of rules and regulations enacted and enforced by political authorities to govern behaviour and maintain social order within a society. Laws are typically written down and specify both the behaviours that are prohibited or required and the sanctions or penalties that will be applied when violations occur. The legal system includes various institutions, such as legislatures that create laws, law enforcement agencies that enforce them, and courts that interpret laws and adjudicate disputes. Law plays a crucial role in establishing norms, resolving conflicts, protecting rights, and providing a framework for social interaction in complex societies. The legitimacy and effectiveness of law depend on its acceptance by the people it governs and its consistent and fair application.

Semantical explanation of healthcare_ID000003: 
Healthcare, in sociology, refers to the social institution and complex system of organisations, professionals, and practices dedicated to maintaining and improving the physical, mental, and social well-being of individuals and populations. This domain encompasses a wide range of services, including medical diagnosis and treatment, disease prevention, health promotion, rehabilitation, and palliative care. Sociologists examine the social determinants of health and illness, investigating how factors like socioeconomic status, race, gender, and geographic location influence health disparities and access to care. The study of healthcare also analyses the social organisation of medical practices, the roles of healthcare providers and patients, the social construction of health and illness (e.g., the sick role), and the impact of health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and holistic medicine approaches. It critically assesses healthcare policies, inequalities in health outcomes, and the broader societal implications of health and disease.

Semantical explanation of social_Inequality_ID000008: 
Social inequality refers to a condition within a society in which its members have significantly different amounts of wealth, income, prestige, power, or other valued resources and opportunities. This unequal distribution can be based on various social categories such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability, often resulting in hierarchical arrangements where some groups have more access to resources and privileges than others. Social inequality is a fundamental topic of study in sociology, with researchers examining its causes, consequences, and the ways in which it is maintained and challenged over time. It can manifest in various forms, including economic disparities, differences in social status and respect, and unequal access to political influence and decision-making power.

Causal relation: {State, Healthcare} → provides → {Social_Inequality, Poverty}

Semantical explanation of poverty_ID000003: 
Poverty refers to a state of deprivation where individuals or families lack the sufficient financial resources or material possessions to meet their basic needs or maintain a living standard considered customary in their society. This broad category encompasses various forms, most commonly distinguished as absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty, also known as subsistence poverty, defines a condition where individuals lack the minimal resources required for basic survival, such as food, shelter, warmth, and safety, often measured by a fixed income threshold. Relative poverty, conversely, defines deprivation in relation to the living standards and average income levels of the majority within a particular society, implying social exclusion and a reduced ability to participate fully in customary activities. The feminisation of poverty highlights the increasing proportion of women among the poor. Poverty is a complex social problem influenced by economic systems, social inequalities, access to resources, and various structural and individual factors, leading to significant social and health consequences.

Causal relation: {Status_Group, Ethnic_Group} → competesWith → {Prestige, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of status_Group_ID000001: 
A status group, as defined by Max Weber, is a category of people within a society who share a similar level of social prestige, honor, or lifestyle, which may or may not be directly related to their economic class position. Membership in a status group is often based on shared attributes such as ethnicity, religion, occupation, education, or family background, which are socially valued or devalued and contribute to a sense of collective identity and social standing. Status groups are characterised by a shared style of life, which can include distinctive patterns of consumption, social interaction, and cultural practices. While class refers to economic position in the market, status is about social honor and can influence social interactions and access to certain social circles or opportunities, sometimes independently of economic factors.

Causal relation: {Status_Group, Ethnic_Group} → competesWith → {Prestige, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of ethnic_Group_ID000004: 
An ethnic group is a group of people who are set apart from others because of their shared national origin or distinctive cultural patterns, which can include language, religion, traditions, customs, and shared history. Members of an ethnic group typically share a sense of common identity and belonging based on these cultural elements, which distinguish them from other groups in society. Ethnicity is a social construct, meaning that it is defined and maintained through social interaction and cultural practices rather than being based on fixed biological traits. The boundaries of ethnic groups can be fluid and may change over time due to factors such as migration, intermarriage, and social and political contexts. The study of ethnic groups is central to understanding cultural diversity, intergroup relations, and issues of identity and belonging in sociology.

Causal relation: {Status_Group, Ethnic_Group} → competesWith → {Prestige, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of prestige_ID000001: 
Prestige in sociology refers to the level of respect, admiration, and social honor that an occupation or social position holds within a society. Different occupations are typically ranked differently in terms of prestige based on factors such as the perceived importance of the work, the level of education or skill required, the income associated with the occupation, and the social status of those who typically hold the position. High-prestige occupations often command more respect and social standing, which can influence individuals' social interactions, opportunities, and overall position within the social hierarchy. Sociologists often study occupational prestige to understand how societies value different types of work and how these valuations contribute to social stratification.

Causal relation: {Status_Group, Ethnic_Group} → competesWith → {Prestige, Social_Inequality}

Semantical explanation of social_Inequality_ID000009: 
Social inequality refers to a condition within a society in which its members have significantly different amounts of wealth, income, prestige, power, or other valued resources and opportunities. This unequal distribution can be based on various social categories such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability, often resulting in hierarchical arrangements where some groups have more access to resources and privileges than others. Social inequality is a fundamental topic of study in sociology, with researchers examining its causes, consequences, and the ways in which it is maintained and challenged over time. It can manifest in various forms, including economic disparities, differences in social status and respect, and unequal access to political influence and decision-making power.

Causal relation: {Stigma} → stigmatises → {Identity}

Semantical explanation of stigma_ID000005: 
Stigma refers to a negative label, mark of disgrace, or social disapproval that is used to devalue members of deviant social groups or individuals who possess certain characteristics or attributes that are seen as undesirable or different from the prevailing social norms. A stigma can be attached to various conditions, behaviours, or identities, such as mental illness, criminal history, physical disabilities, certain lifestyles, or membership in particular social groups. The process of stigmatisation can lead to social exclusion, discrimination, prejudice, and a loss of social status for the stigmatised individuals or groups, often impacting their self-esteem, social interactions, and opportunities in life. Labeling theory in sociology highlights the role of stigma in the social construction of deviance and its consequences for those who are labeled.

Causal relation: {Stigma} → stigmatises → {Identity}

Semantical explanation of identity_ID000010: 
Identity refers to the distinctive characteristics of a person's character or the character of a group which relate to who they are and what is meaningful to them, providing a sense of self and belonging. Some of the main sources of identity include gender, encompassing social expectations of masculinity and femininity; sexual orientation, referring to patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction; nationality or ethnicity, based on shared cultural heritage, origin, and often language or religion; and social class, reflecting one's position in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Identity is not fixed but is fluid and can evolve over an individual's life course through interactions with others and within different social contexts. It shapes how individuals perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others, influencing their social interactions, opportunities, and experiences within society.

Causal relation: {Suburb} → spatiallyRelatedTo → {Segregation, Migration}

Semantical explanation of suburb_ID000002: 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a suburb is defined as any territory within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) that is not included in the central city or cities of that MSA. Metropolitan areas are typically defined as having at least one urbanised area of 50,000 or more people, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core urban area, as measured by commuting ties. Suburbs are often characterised by lower population density compared to central cities, a higher proportion of single-family homes, and a greater reliance on automobiles for transportation. They have become a significant form of residential and commercial development in many industrialised countries, often representing a migration of population and economic activity away from the central urban core. The development and characteristics of suburbs are influenced by various factors, including transportation infrastructure, housing policies, economic trends, and social preferences.

Causal relation: {Suburb} → spatiallyRelatedTo → {Segregation, Migration}

Semantical explanation of segregation_ID000006: 
Segregation refers to the act and process of physically, socially, or legally separating two or more groups of people, often based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or socioeconomic status. While segregation can occur in various forms, it is frequently imposed on a minority group by a dominant group within a society, leading to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social institutions such as housing, education, healthcare, and employment. Segregation can be enforced through explicit laws and policies (de jure segregation) or through informal social norms and practices (de facto segregation). It often results in social isolation, limited intergroup contact, and the perpetuation of inequalities between the separated groups. The history of segregation in various parts of the world, such as racial segregation in the United States and apartheid in South Africa, demonstrates its profound and lasting negative impacts on marginalised groups and society as a whole.

Causal relation: {Suburb} → spatiallyRelatedTo → {Segregation, Migration}

Semantical explanation of migration_ID000006: 
Migration refers to the movement of people into and out of a particular territory, which can occur within a country (internal migration) or across national borders (international migration). This movement can be temporary or permanent and can be driven by a variety of factors, including economic opportunities, political instability, environmental changes, social networks, and personal aspirations. Immigration involves the movement of people into a new country to settle, while emigration refers to the movement of people out of a country to live elsewhere. Migration patterns can have significant demographic, economic, social, and cultural impacts on both the areas of origin and the areas of destination, influencing population size and composition, labor markets, cultural diversity, and social integration. Sociologists study migration to understand its causes and consequences, the experiences of migrants, and the policies and social responses to migration flows.

Causal relation: {Formal_Social_Control, State} → monitors → {Observation, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of formal_Social_Control_ID000007: 
Formal social control refers to the mechanisms and processes used by authorised agents and institutions within society to maintain order, enforce laws, and ensure conformity to established norms and rules. These agents include police officers, judges, school administrators, employers, and other individuals who have been given the authority to enforce social norms and impose sanctions when violations occur. Formal social control is characterised by its reliance on written rules, laws, and regulations, as well as established procedures for identifying and punishing deviant behaviour. Examples of formal social control mechanisms include arrests, prosecutions, disciplinary actions, and legal penalties. It plays a crucial role in maintaining social stability and protecting societal values and interests, often working in conjunction with informal social control mechanisms, such as social disapproval and peer pressure.

Causal relation: {Formal_Social_Control, State} → monitors → {Observation, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of state_ID000004: 
The state in sociology refers to a political apparatus or organised structure of rule that governs a specific territory and its population, characterised by its authority, which is generally backed by law, and its capacity to use force to maintain order and enforce its policies. It typically includes governmental institutions such as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as the civil service officials who administer state functions. A key feature of the state is its claim to sovereignty over the territory and its citizens, meaning it asserts the ultimate authority within its borders, often recognised by other states in the international system. The state plays a crucial role in establishing and enforcing laws, providing public services, regulating the economy, and defending its territory and interests, often relying on a monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within its boundaries to ensure compliance and maintain social order.

Causal relation: {Formal_Social_Control, State} → monitors → {Observation, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of observation_ID000002: 
Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.

Causal relation: {Formal_Social_Control, State} → monitors → {Observation, Social_Control}

Semantical explanation of social_Control_ID000016: 
Social control refers to the diverse techniques, mechanisms, and strategies that are used by individuals, groups, institutions, and societies to prevent or regulate deviant human behaviour and to ensure conformity to established norms, rules, and laws. Social control can be informal, operating through everyday social interactions and the use of social sanctions such as disapproval, ridicule, or ostracism within families, peer groups, and communities. It can also be formal, involving the use of laws, regulations, and the authority of institutions like the police, courts, and correctional systems to enforce norms and punish deviance. The goal of social control is to maintain social order, stability, and cohesion within a society.

Semantical explanation of innovation_ID000007: 
Innovation is the process of introducing new elements, ideas, methods, or products into a culture or society, leading to change and often improvement. This can occur through two primary mechanisms: discovery and invention. Discovery involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown or unrecognised, such as a new scientific fact or a previously unknown natural resource. Invention, on the other hand, involves creating something entirely new that did not exist before, such as a new technology, a new tool, or a new process. Both discovery and invention can have profound impacts on a culture, leading to new practices, beliefs, social structures, and material advancements. The rate and nature of innovation can vary significantly across different societies and historical periods, influenced by factors such as technological development, cultural values, and social organisation.

Semantical explanation of internet_ID000009: 
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that allows people to communicate with one another and find information on the Worldwide Web by exchanging data in various forms, including visuals, sounds, and text. This vast network operates in a way that largely transcends the limitations of time, physical space, and the traditional costs and control mechanisms associated with distance and territorial governments. The Internet has become an indispensable tool for communication, education, commerce, entertainment, and social interaction, connecting billions of people around the world and providing access to an unprecedented amount of information and resources. Its decentralised nature and open architecture have fostered innovation and the rapid development of new technologies and applications, transforming many aspects of modern life and contributing to the phenomenon of globalisation.

Semantical explanation of economy_ID000008: 
The economy refers to the system of production and exchange which provides for the material needs of individuals living in a given society. It encompasses all activities related to the creation, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The economy is a fundamental aspect of social life, as it shapes how people earn a living, access resources, and interact with one another in the process of fulfilling their material needs and wants. The structure and functioning of the economy are influenced by a complex interplay of social, cultural, political, and technological factors. Sociologists study the economy to understand its impact on social inequality, social mobility, work, and other aspects of social life. Different types of economies, such as agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial economies, have distinct characteristics and social consequences.

Causal relation: {Innovation, Internet} → influencesHistorically → {Economy, Economic_And_Industrial_Transformation_Processes}

Semantical explanation of economic_And_Industrial_Transformation_Processes_ID000001: 
Economic_And_Industrial_Transformation_Processes encompasses the fundamental shifts in economic organisation, production systems, and industrial structures that characterise major transitions in societal development. These processes involve comprehensive changes in how societies organise production, distribute goods and services, and structure economic relationships between different social classes and institutions. The transformation from traditional agricultural economies to industrial systems, and subsequently to post-industrial arrangements, represents one of the most significant social changes in human history. These processes are characterised by technological innovation, changes in labor organisation, shifts in the relationship between capital and labor, and the emergence of new forms of economic coordination and control. The Industrial Revolution exemplifies how technological advancement can trigger cascading social changes that reshape entire societies. Post-Fordism demonstrates how production systems continue to evolve in response to technological capabilities and market demands. Deindustrialisation shows how economic transformation can also involve the decline of previously dominant sectors, creating new challenges and opportunities. These processes fundamentally alter social stratification, work experiences, community structures, and the overall organisation of social life, making them central to understanding modern socioeconomic development.

Causal relation: {Innovation, Cultural_Pluralism} → hasInfluence → {Social_Change, Modernisation}

Semantical explanation of cultural_Pluralism_ID000002: 
Cultural pluralism refers to the coexistence of several subcultures within a given society on equal terms, where no single culture dominates and all are recognised and respected for their distinct contributions. In a culturally pluralistic society, different ethnic, racial, religious, and other cultural groups are able to maintain their unique identities, traditions, and practices while participating fully in the broader society. This is often contrasted with assimilation, where minority groups are expected to adopt the culture of the dominant group. Cultural pluralism emphasises the value of diversity and the benefits of having a society enriched by multiple perspectives and traditions. It requires a degree of tolerance and mutual respect among different cultural groups and often involves policies and practices that protect the rights and promote the inclusion of all cultural groups within the society. The concept of a "salad bowl" is often used as a metaphor for cultural pluralism, where different ingredients (cultures) are mixed together but retain their individual flavors and characteristics, rather than being completely blended into a single entity like in a "melting pot" (often used to describe amalgamation).

Semantical explanation of social_Change_ID000012: 
Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Causal relation: {Innovation, Cultural_Pluralism} → hasInfluence → {Social_Change, Modernisation}

Semantical explanation of modernisation_ID000002: 
Modernisation is a far-reaching and complex process by which a society undergoes a fundamental transformation from traditional or less developed institutions, social structures, and cultural practices to those characteristic of more developed, industrialised, and often urbanised societies. This process typically involves significant changes in various aspects of social life, including the economy (shift from agriculture to industry), political systems (often towards democracy and increased state capacity), social structures (greater social mobility and differentiation), cultural values (emphasis on individualism, secularism, and rationality), and technology (adoption of advanced technologies). Modernisation is often associated with improvements in living standards, education, healthcare, and overall societal complexity, but it can also bring about social disruptions, inequalities, and challenges to traditional ways of life. Sociologists study modernisation to understand its causes, consequences, and the different paths that societies take in this transformative process.

Semantical explanation of science_ID000003: 
Science is a systematic and logical system of acquiring knowledge about the natural and social world that bases its understanding on direct, systematic observation, empirical evidence, experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses and theories. It is characterised by its commitment to objectivity, empirical verification, and a self-correcting process where new evidence can lead to the revision or rejection of existing knowledge. The scientific method provides a structured approach to conducting research, ensuring rigor and minimizing bias in the pursuit of understanding how the world works. In sociology, science aims to apply these principles to the study of social behaviour, social structures, and social phenomena to develop reliable and valid knowledge about the social world.

Semantical explanation of social_Change_ID000013: 
Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Causal relation: {Innovation, Science} → innovates → {Social_Change, Modernisation}

Semantical explanation of modernisation_ID000003: 
Modernisation is a far-reaching and complex process by which a society undergoes a fundamental transformation from traditional or less developed institutions, social structures, and cultural practices to those characteristic of more developed, industrialised, and often urbanised societies. This process typically involves significant changes in various aspects of social life, including the economy (shift from agriculture to industry), political systems (often towards democracy and increased state capacity), social structures (greater social mobility and differentiation), cultural values (emphasis on individualism, secularism, and rationality), and technology (adoption of advanced technologies). Modernisation is often associated with improvements in living standards, education, healthcare, and overall societal complexity, but it can also bring about social disruptions, inequalities, and challenges to traditional ways of life. Sociologists study modernisation to understand its causes, consequences, and the different paths that societies take in this transformative process.

Semantical explanation of innovation_ID000010: 
Innovation is the process of introducing new elements, ideas, methods, or products into a culture or society, leading to change and often improvement. This can occur through two primary mechanisms: discovery and invention. Discovery involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown or unrecognised, such as a new scientific fact or a previously unknown natural resource. Invention, on the other hand, involves creating something entirely new that did not exist before, such as a new technology, a new tool, or a new process. Both discovery and invention can have profound impacts on a culture, leading to new practices, beliefs, social structures, and material advancements.

Causal relation: {Innovation, Industrial_Revolution} → innovates → {Social_Change, Invention}

Semantical explanation of industrial_Revolution_ID000002: 
The Industrial Revolution refers to the broad spectrum of profound social and economic transformations that surrounded the development of modern forms of industry, beginning in Great Britain in the late 18th century and spreading to other parts of the world throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. This period was marked by significant technological innovations, particularly the invention of new machines and the use of new energy sources like steam power, which led to the rise of factory-based production and a shift from agrarian-based economies to those dominated by manufacturing and industry. The Industrial Revolution had far-reaching consequences, leading to urbanisation, the growth of new social classes, changes in family structures, and significant alterations in people's daily lives and ways of working. It laid the foundation for modern industrial societies and continues to shape the world today through ongoing technological advancements and their social and economic impacts.

Semantical explanation of invention_ID000002: 
Invention is the process of combining existing cultural items, ideas, or technologies into a new form that did not previously exist. It involves creativity and innovation to produce something novel, whether it is a tangible object, a new method, or a new concept. Inventions can range from simple tools to complex technological systems and can have significant impacts on society and culture, leading to social change and the development of new ways of life. Invention is one of the primary drivers of cultural innovation, alongside discovery, which involves becoming aware of something that already exists but was previously unknown. The spread and adoption of inventions within a culture or across societies is a process known as diffusion.

This domain encompasses a wide range of services, including medical diagnosis and treatment, disease prevention, health promotion, rehabilitation, and palliative care. Sociologists examine the social determinants of health and illness, investigating how factors like socioeconomic status, race, gender, and geographic location influence health disparities and access to care. The study of healthcare also analyses the social organisation of medical practices, the roles of healthcare providers and patients, the social construction of health and illness (e.g., the sick role), and the impact of health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and holistic medicine approaches. It critically assesses healthcare policies, inequalities in health outcomes, and the broader societal implications of health and disease.

Semantical explanation of holistic_Medicine_ID000001: 
Holistic medicine is an approach to health maintenance and healthcare that uses therapies in which the healthcare practitioner considers the whole person â€“ their physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual characteristics â€“ rather than focusing solely on the physical symptoms of an illness. This approach emphasises the interconnectedness of these different aspects of well-being and aims to treat the root causes of illness by addressing the individual's overall health and lifestyle. Holistic practitioners may use a variety of therapeutic modalities, including lifestyle changes, stress reduction techniques, nutritional guidance, exercise programs, and complementary and alternative therapies, in addition to conventional medical treatments, to promote healing and well-being. The focus is on treating the individual as a whole and empowering them to take an active role in their own health and healing process.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Revolution} → urbanises → {Urban_Ecology, Metropolis}

Semantical explanation of urbanisation_ID000003: 
Urbanisation refers to the process of the development of towns and cities, typically involving the growth in the size and population of urban areas and the increasing concentration of people living and working in these areas. This process is often linked to economic development, industrialisation, and the migration of people from rural to urban areas in search of opportunities. Urbanisation leads to significant transformations in land use, infrastructure development, social organisation, and lifestyles, creating complex urban environments that serve as centers of economic, political, and cultural activity. The study of urbanisation examines its causes, patterns, and consequences for societies, including issues related to urban planning, housing, transportation, social inequality, and environmental sustainability.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Revolution} → urbanises → {Urban_Ecology, Metropolis}

Semantical explanation of industrial_Revolution_ID000003: 
The Industrial Revolution refers to the broad spectrum of profound social and economic transformations that surrounded the development of modern forms of industry, beginning in Great Britain in the late 18th century and spreading to other parts of the world throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. This period was marked by significant technological innovations, particularly the invention of new machines and the use of new energy sources like steam power, which led to the rise of factory-based production and a shift from agrarian-based economies to those dominated by manufacturing and industry. The Industrial Revolution had far-reaching consequences, leading to urbanisation, the growth of new social classes, changes in family structures, and significant alterations in people's daily lives and ways of working. It laid the foundation for modern industrial societies and continues to shape the world today through ongoing technological advancements and their social and economic impacts.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Revolution} → urbanises → {Urban_Ecology, Metropolis}

Semantical explanation of urban_Ecology_ID000003: 
Urban ecology is a subfield within sociology that focuses on the study of the intricate link and dynamic interrelationships between the physical and social dimensions of cities, examining how the spatial organisation, physical environment, and material infrastructure of urban areas shape social life, human behaviour, and community dynamics, and vice versa. It explores topics such as the distribution of populations, resources, and social problems within urban spaces, the impact of urban design and planning on social interactions, the relationship between urban environments and human health, and the processes of urban growth, change, and sustainability. Drawing on ecological principles, urban ecology views the city as a complex ecosystem where social and physical factors are interdependent and constantly interacting to shape the urban experience.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Revolution} → urbanises → {Urban_Ecology, Metropolis}

Semantical explanation of metropolis_ID000001: 
A metropolis is a large city that socially and economically dominates an urban area, often serving as a major center for commerce, culture, and innovation within a region or even a country. It typically has a high population density, a diverse economy, and a significant influence on the surrounding areas in terms of employment, services, and cultural trends. A metropolis often attracts people from smaller towns and rural areas seeking opportunities and amenities not available elsewhere. The term can also refer to the central city of a metropolitan area, which includes the city itself and its surrounding suburbs and exurbs that are economically and socially integrated with it. Metropolises play a crucial role in the global economy and are often hubs for international trade, finance, and communication.

Semantical explanation of gentrification_ID000003: 
Gentrification is a process of urban renewal in which older, decaying housing and neighborhoods in central city areas are refurbished and revitalised by more affluent people, often resulting in the displacement of the original, lower-income residents. This process typically involves the renovation of buildings, the influx of new businesses and amenities catering to a higher-income clientele, and an increase in property values and rents, making the area unaffordable for many of its long-term residents. While gentrification can lead to the physical improvement of neglected urban areas, it often raises concerns about social equity and the displacement of vulnerable populations, potentially leading to the loss of affordable housing and the disruption of established communities. The causes and consequences of gentrification are complex and have been a subject of much sociological research and debate, with discussions focusing on issues of urban planning, housing policy, and social justice.

Causal relation: {Gentrification, Urban_Renewal} → gentrifies → {Working_Class, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of urban_Renewal_ID000002: 
Urban renewal is a comprehensive process aimed at reviving and revitalizing deteriorating neighborhoods and urban areas that may be experiencing decline, disinvestment, or social problems. It typically involves a range of strategies, such as recycling underutilised land and existing buildings for new purposes, improving the physical environment through infrastructure upgrades and beautification projects, implementing better management practices for local areas with the active participation of local citizens, and strategically using public funds to stimulate regeneration and attract further private investment. The goals of urban renewal often include enhancing the quality of life for residents, fostering economic development, improving housing conditions, and creating more vibrant and sustainable urban communities. However, urban renewal projects can sometimes lead to unintended consequences such as gentrification and the displacement of existing low-income residents, making community engagement and equitable planning crucial aspects of the process.

Causal relation: {Gentrification, Urban_Renewal} → gentrifies → {Working_Class, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of working_Class_ID000013: 
The working class is a social class broadly composed of people who are primarily involved in blue-collar or manual occupations, typically involving physical labor and often in industries such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. Membership in the working class is often defined by the type of work performed and may be associated with lower levels of formal education and income compared to the middle or upper classes. Historically, the working class has played a significant role in industrial societies, and their labor is essential for the production of goods and services. The term can also encompass those in lower-skilled service sector jobs. While the specific boundaries and characteristics of the working class can vary across different societies and over time, it generally refers to individuals and families who rely on wages or salaries from manual or less skilled labor for their primary source of income and who may have less economic security and social mobility compared to other social classes.

Causal relation: {Gentrification, Urban_Renewal} → gentrifies → {Working_Class, Social_Class}

Semantical explanation of social_Class_ID000011: 
Social Class is a fundamental concept within social stratification, referring to a large group of people who share a similar economic position in society, primarily based on their relationship to the means of production, income, wealth, and occupation. While specific definitions vary, major sociological class distinctions often include the upper class (those with inherited wealth or control of large businesses), the middle class (professionals, managers, small business owners), the working class (manual or blue-collar laborers), and the underclass (those experiencing chronic poverty and marginalisation). Social class influences an individual's life chances, affecting their access to education, healthcare, housing, and opportunities for social mobility. Marxist theory emphasises class consciousness and the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the proletariat (working class) over the means of production. Understanding social class is crucial for analysing structured inequalities, economic exploitation, and the distribution of power and resources within a society.

Causal relation: {Gentrification, Urban_Renewal} → gentrifies → {Working_Class, Social_Exclusion}

Semantical explanation of social_Exclusion_ID000008: 
Social exclusion is a complex and multidimensional process and outcome where individuals or groups are prevented from fully participating in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of the society in which they are located due to a combination of multiple and often intersecting deprivations. These deprivations can include lack of adequate income and resources, limited access to employment, education, healthcare, housing, and social support networks, as well as experiences of discrimination, marginalisation, and a lack of voice or power in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Social exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and a diminished sense of belonging, hindering individuals' ability to exercise their rights, fulfill their potential, and participate as full and valued members of society. Addressing social exclusion requires tackling the various interconnected factors that contribute to it through inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and social integration for all members of society.

Causal relation: {Government, Bureaucracy} → regulates → {Urbanism, Organisation}

Semantical explanation of government_ID000006: 
Government refers to the regular enactment of policies, decisions, and matters of state by officials within a political apparatus, representing the formal organisation that has the authority to make and enforce laws and regulations within a specific territory or society. It encompasses the various institutions and processes through which a state exercises its power and authority, including legislative bodies that create laws, executive branches that implement and enforce them, and judicial systems that interpret laws and resolve disputes. Governments play a crucial role in maintaining social order, providing public services, regulating the economy, and representing the interests of the state in its interactions with other nations. The form and structure of government can vary widely, ranging from democracies to authoritarian regimes, each with different mechanisms for the selection of officials and the exercise of power. Political sociology examines the role of government in society, its relationship with citizens and other social institutions, and the factors that influence its policies and actions.

Semantical explanation of bureaucracy_ID000008: 
Bureaucracy is an organisation of a hierarchical sort, which takes the form of a pyramid of authority, with clear lines of command and responsibility. The term 'bureaucracy' was popularised by Max Weber, who considered it the most efficient type of large-scale human organisation in modern society. According to Weber, bureaucracy is characterised by a division of labor, a clearly defined hierarchy, formal rules and regulations, impersonality, and a focus on technical competence. As organisations grow in size and complexity, Weber argued, they inevitably tend to become more and more bureaucratised to manage their operations effectively.

Causal relation: {Government, Bureaucracy} → regulates → {Urbanism, Organisation}

Semantical explanation of urbanism_ID000002: 
Urbanism is a term used by sociologist Louis Wirth to denote the distinctive characteristics of social life that emerge in urban settings, particularly in large, densely populated cities, such as a greater degree of impersonality, anonymity, social heterogeneity, and a more complex division of labor compared to rural areas. Wirth argued that the size, density, and heterogeneity of urban populations shape the nature of social interactions and the social psychology of city dwellers, often leading to more formal and instrumental relationships, increased social tolerance for diversity, and a greater sense of individual freedom alongside potential feelings of social isolation or alienation. The study of urbanism explores how these unique social patterns and experiences in cities differ from those in more rural or traditional communities.

Causal relation: {Government, Bureaucracy} → regulates → {Urbanism, Organisation}

Semantical explanation of organisation_ID000005: 
An organisation in sociology refers to a large group of individuals who are structured and coordinated to achieve specific goals or purposes, involving a definite set of authority relations, rules, and procedures that govern their activities. Organisations can range from formal entities like corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions to more informal groups with shared objectives. They are characterised by a division of labor, a hierarchy of authority, and established patterns of communication and interaction among their members. Sociologists study organisations to understand their structure, culture, dynamics, and their role in shaping social life and achieving collective goals.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Society} → urbanises → {Urbanism, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of urbanisation_ID000004: 
Urbanisation refers to the process of the development of towns and cities, typically involving the growth in the size and population of urban areas and the increasing concentration of people living and working in these areas. This process is often linked to economic development, industrialisation, and the migration of people from rural to urban areas in search of opportunities. Urbanisation leads to significant transformations in land use, infrastructure development, social organisation, and lifestyles, creating complex urban environments that serve as centers of economic, political, and cultural activity. The study of urbanisation examines its causes, patterns, and consequences for societies, including issues related to urban planning, housing, transportation, social inequality, and environmental sustainability.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Society} → urbanises → {Urbanism, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of industrial_Society_ID000003: 
An industrial society is a type of society that depends primarily on mechanisation, advanced technology, and sophisticated machinery powered by advanced energy sources to produce its economic goods and services on a large scale. This form of society emerged with the Industrial Revolution and is characterised by a complex division of labor, a high degree of urbanisation as people move to centers of production, and a reliance on manufacturing and industrial processes rather than agriculture as the main source of economic activity. Industrial societies typically have a more complex social structure with greater social mobility compared to pre-industrial societies, although they can also experience significant social inequalities related to the distribution of wealth and power in the industrial economy. The development of industrial societies has led to significant increases in productivity, material wealth, and standards of living in many parts of the world, but also to new social and environmental challenges.

Causal relation: {Urbanisation, Industrial_Society} → urbanises → {Urbanism, Social_Structure}

Semantical explanation of social_Structure_ID000005: 
Social structure refers to the underlying patterns of social relationships, institutions, and social organisation that shape and constrain individuals' behaviour and interactions within a society, providing a framework for social life. It is the way in which a society is organised into predictable relationships and hierarchies based on factors such as social class, gender, race, ethnicity, age, and social institutions like the family, education, government, and the economy. Social structure is not always immediately visible but exerts a powerful influence on individuals' opportunities, experiences, and life chances. Sociologists study social structure to understand the enduring patterns of social behaviour and the ways in which society is organised at a macro level.

Causal relation: {World_Systems, Multinational_Corporations} → controls → {Core_Countries, Peripheral_Countries}

Semantical explanation of world_Systems_ID000001: 
World-systems theory, pioneered by sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein, is a macro-level perspective that emphasises the interconnections and interdependence among countries based on the historical expansion and current functioning of a global capitalist world economy. This theory posits that the world economy is not a collection of independent national economies but rather a single, integrated system characterised by a global division of labor and a hierarchical structure consisting of three main categories of countries: core countries, which are the wealthy, industrialised nations that dominate the global economy and control advanced technology and capital; semi-peripheral countries, which occupy an intermediate position, often supplying labor and raw materials to the core and serving as a buffer between the core and the periphery, with some level of industrialisation and potential for upward or downward mobility within the system; and peripheral countries, which have a marginal role in the world economy, often specializing in the production of raw materials and agricultural goods for the core, and are thus economically dependent on and often exploited by the core countries in unequal trading relationships. This theory highlights how the dynamics of the global capitalist system shape the economic development and social structures of nations within it, emphasizing historical processes of colonialism and neocolonialism in creating and maintaining global inequalities.

Causal relation: {World_Systems, Multinational_Corporations} → controls → {Core_Countries, Peripheral_Countries}

Semantical explanation of multinational_Corporations_ID000006: 
Multinational corporations (MNCs) are large commercial organisations that are headquartered in one country (the home country) but conduct business operations, including production, marketing, sales, and research and development, in numerous other countries around the world (host countries). These corporations often have significant economic power and play a major role in the global economy through foreign direct investment, international trade, and the transfer of technology and capital across borders. MNCs can have both positive and negative impacts on the countries in which they operate, providing jobs and investment but also potentially raising issues related to labor practices, environmental regulations, and economic sovereignty. The study of multinational corporations is an important area in sociology, particularly in the context of globalisation and its effects on national economies and societies.

They typically have strong state institutions, well-developed infrastructure, and a highly skilled workforce. Core countries dominate global trade and finance, often exploiting peripheral and semi-peripheral countries for raw materials and cheap labor. Examples of core countries include the United States, Japan, and Germany. This dominance allows core countries to maintain their economic and political power in the global arena, perpetuating a system of unequal exchange. World-systems theory, developed by Immanuel Wallerstein, emphasises the interconnectedness of the global economy and the hierarchical relationship between core, semi-peripheral, and peripheral nations.

Causal relation: {World_Systems, Multinational_Corporations} → controls → {Core_Countries, Peripheral_Countries}

Semantical explanation of peripheral_Countries_ID000001: 
Peripheral countries, according to world-systems theory developed by Immanuel Wallerstein, are those countries that have a marginal and often subordinate role in the global economy and are thus dependent on the core-producing (wealthy, industrialised) societies for their trading relationships, often serving as sources of raw materials, cheap labor, and markets for core countries' products. These countries typically have less diversified economies, weaker state institutions, and lower levels of industrialisation and technological development compared to core and semi-peripheral nations. The economic relationships between core and peripheral countries are often characterised by unequal exchange, where peripheral nations may be exploited for their resources and labor, hindering their own economic development and perpetuating global inequalities.

Causal relation: {Youth_Culture, Social_Movement} → mobilises → {Social_Change, Culture}

Semantical explanation of youth_Culture_ID000002: 
Youth culture refers to the specific cultural attributes, norms, values, practices, styles, and forms of expression exhibited by many young people within a particular period or society, often characterised by a sense of shared identity, interests, and experiences that are distinct from those of other age groups, particularly adults. Youth culture can manifest in various aspects of life, including behavioural norms, dress codes, language use (such as slang), musical preferences, leisure activities, and attitudes towards social issues, many of which tend to differ from the prevailing adult culture of the time and may even represent a form of rebellion or a search for autonomy and identity formation during the transitional period of adolescence and young adulthood. Youth cultures are dynamic and can change rapidly, often influenced by popular media, technology, and social trends, and they can play a significant role in shaping broader cultural landscapes and driving social change.

Causal relation: {Youth_Culture, Social_Movement} → mobilises → {Social_Change, Culture}

Semantical explanation of social_Movement_ID000014: 
A social movement encompasses collective attempts by a group of people to further a common interest or secure a shared goal through organised action that typically takes place outside the sphere of established political institutions and conventional channels. These movements often arise in response to perceived social, economic, or political grievances and seek to bring about or resist social change, existing in a dynamic relationship, often one of conflict, with organisations or power structures whose objectives and outlook they frequently oppose. Social movements can vary widely in their goals, tactics, organisational structures, and the scale of change they aim to achieve, ranging from advocating for specific policy reforms to seeking fundamental transformations in societal norms and values. While they operate outside of formal political systems, successful social movements can sometimes influence policy and, if they manage to gain significant power and become institutionalised, may evolve into formal organisations or even political parties.

Causal relation: {Youth_Culture, Social_Movement} → mobilises → {Social_Change, Culture}

Semantical explanation of social_Change_ID000016: 
Social change refers to significant alterations over time in the behaviour patterns, social structures, cultural norms, values, and beliefs of a society or a significant part of it. This can occur at various levels, from micro-level changes in individual behaviours and interactions to macro-level transformations in institutions and global systems. Social change can be driven by a multitude of factors, including technological innovations, economic shifts, demographic changes, social movements, cultural diffusion, and political events. It is a continuous and dynamic process that shapes the evolution of societies and can have both positive and negative consequences for different groups within a society.

Causal relation: {Youth_Culture, Social_Movement} → mobilises → {Social_Change, Culture}

Semantical explanation of culture_ID000009: 
Culture encompasses the values, beliefs, ceremonies, ways of life, norms, symbols, and material goods characteristic of a given group or society. Like the concept of society, the notion of culture is very widely used in sociology, as well as in other social sciences, particularly anthropology. Culture is one of the most distinctive properties of human social association, differentiating human societies from animal societies in its complexity and transmission through learning rather than solely through instinct. It includes everything that is learned and shared by the members of a society, shaping their behaviour and their understanding of the world. Culture can be broadly divided into material culture, which includes tangible objects created by a society (such as tools, technology, clothing, and art), and nonmaterial culture, which includes intangible aspects such as ideas, values, beliefs, norms, language, and social institutions. Culture provides a framework for social interaction, defines what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and gives meaning to people's lives. It is dynamic and constantly evolving through processes of innovation, diffusion, and adaptation.
